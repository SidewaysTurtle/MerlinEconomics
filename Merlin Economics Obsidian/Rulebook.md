## Welcome Letter

Dear Wizard, Witch, or Sentient Newt,

Welcome to Merlin Economics, a simulation of medieval wizard economies adapted from Merlin's seminal work "*Magical Financing 101 and 100 Additional Toad Recipes*". Navigate the complexities of a magical economy through property management, commodity speculation, and economic forecasting.

Whether you're a seasoned merchant-mage or a novice economic enchanter, you'll find yourself deeply engaged in a world where market forces meet magical mayhem.

## Overview
Merlin Economics is a strategic economic simulation game for **4-6 players** set in a medieval wizard world. Players simulate a complex wizard economy by managing properties, trading commodities, speculating on markets, and navigating economic uncertainties.

Through careful resource management, market manipulation, and occasional magical mischief, players work to become the dominant economic force in the realm. Success requires mastering multiple aspects of the magical economy - from property development to commodity speculation, from spell research to market manipulation.

# Getting Started: Embarking on Your Path to Magical Riches

*Centuries ago, the great wizard Merlin laid the foundation for the arcane arts of economics. Now, you stand poised to follow in his footsteps, ready to master the mystical forces of supply and demand, and build your own merchant empire.*

This section will guide you through the initial steps of your journey, from setting up the game to understanding the flow of your first few turns.

## Game Setup: Preparing the Mystical Marketplace

Before you can begin your ascent to economic dominance, you must prepare the game components, transforming your mundane surroundings into a vibrant marketplace, brimming with magical potential.

1. **Establish the Grand Bazaar:** Clear a spacious table to serve as the central hub of commerce. This area will house:

    *   **Player Fields:** Each player will have a designated area, their **field**, where they will manage their **properties**, **permits**, **Golems**, **Royal Guard**, and personal **gold** reserves.
    *   **Central Market:** This is where the magical **commodities** (Souls, Elixir Oil, Essence Grain) will be traded, their values fluctuating with the tides of supply and demand.
    *   **The Wheel of Fate:** Place the **Season Wheel** within view. This wheel tracks the passage of time and the ever-shifting magical energies that influence the realm. **Note:** The Erratic Season Wheel is set aside for now, only coming into play when the Climate Change counter indicates significant disruption to the magical climate.
    *   **Climate Change Counter:** Place a post-it note under the Season Wheel to track **Climate Change**. Use tally marks to record the changes to the magical environment.
    *   **Arcane Trackers:** Place the **Research Cost Counter** and **Cost of The Living Counter** nearby. These devices will track the ever-shifting costs and economic pressures of the magical world.
    *   **The Decks of Destiny:** Shuffle each deck (Properties, Spells, Potions, Tea Leaves, Crystal Balls, Royal Decrees) separately and place them face down within reach. These cards hold the keys to your future success (or spectacular failure).
2. **Assemble the Components of Power:**

    *   **Set the Wheel of Fate:** The **Season Wheel** begins at the 'Start of Summer' position.
    *   **Establish Base Costs:** Set the **Research Cost Counter** to **1** and the **Cost of the Living Counter** to **2**. These represent the initial costs associated with arcane research and the basic necessities of life in this magical realm.
    *   **Begin with a Stable Climate:** The **Climate Change Counter** starts at **zero**, indicated by a blank post-it note, signifying a relatively stable magical environment (for now).
    *   **Distribute Starting Wealth:** Each player begins their journey with **10 gold** pieces, the foundation of their future empire.
    *   **Form the Central Bank:** Designate an area or container to hold the undistributed gold, the lifeblood of the magical economy.
    *   **Establish the Revenue Office of Wizards (R.O.W.):** Designate an area or container for collected taxes, the dues owed to the governing body of this realm.
    *   **Create the Grand Market:** Set up **bid/ask tables** for each commodity: **Souls**, **Elixir Oil**, and **Essence Grain**. This is where fortunes will be made and lost through shrewd trading.

> [!TIP]
> A well-organized merchant-mage is a successful one. Ensure your play area is neatly arranged, allowing you to easily track your resources, monitor the market, and anticipate the actions of your rivals.

## The First Turn: A Glimpse into the Flow of Commerce

*With the marketplace assembled, you are ready to embark on your first turn, a microcosm of the cyclical dance of commerce that drives the magical economy.*

1. **The Blind Auction - Determining Turn Order:**

    *   Before the first turn, players engage in a **blind auction** to determine the order of play. Each player secretly selects a portion of their **10 starting gold** as their bid, concealing it within their closed fist.
    *   All players reveal their bids simultaneously, the echoes of ancient merchant traditions resonating through the ages.
    *   The player with the **highest bid** earns the right to go first, their ambition and wealth securing their place at the forefront of the market.
    *   The **second highest** bid goes second, and so on, until the player with the **lowest bid** takes the final position.
    *   The collected gold from the auction is then divided: half is bestowed upon the last-place merchant, a small consolation for their humility, while the other half is deposited into the **Central Bank**, fueling the engine of the magical economy.
2. **The Rhythm of the Market - Your First Turn:**

    *   **Cast the Dice of Fate:** Roll two six-sided dice. The numbers rolled determine which **properties** and **land** cards generate resources across all player **fields**, a testament to the unpredictable nature of fortune.
    *   **Consult the Seers - Draw a Future Reading Card:** Draw the top card from either the **Tea Leaves** or **Crystal Ball** deck. Place it face up in a designated area, allowing all players to glimpse the potential future that awaits. These cards foretell events that may come to pass, adding an element of foresight and strategic planning to your endeavors.
    *   **The Dance of Commerce - Taking Actions:** Now, the heart of your turn unfolds. You may take a variety of actions, in any order you deem most advantageous. *Declare each action clearly, for transparency is paramount in the magical marketplace.* These actions represent your influence upon the economy, your ability to manipulate resources, and your strategic cunning:

        *   **A. Property Management:**
            *   **Lay Claim to Properties:** Purchase available **property** cards and add them to your **field**, expanding your holdings and increasing your potential for gold generation.
            *   **Acquire Permits:** Enhance your properties with **permits** (Land, Spell Shops, Breweries), each offering unique benefits, from resource generation to arcane research capabilities.

        *   **B. Magic & Market Manipulation:**
            *   **Fund Arcane Research:** Invest gold in **Spell** or **Potion** research, seeking to unlock powerful magic that can disrupt your rivals or enhance your own operations.
            *   **Establish Spell Shops and Breweries:** Combine successful **Spell Labs** or **Potion Labs** with properties to create specialized establishments that offer unique benefits and opportunities.
            *   **Trade in the Grand Market:** Buy and sell **commodities** (Souls, Elixir Oil, Essence Grain) at the **bid/ask tables**, speculating on market trends and striving to amass wealth through shrewd trades.
            *   **Forge Futures Contracts:** If you have established a **Chauffeur**, you may create and trade **futures contracts** for commodities, a sophisticated form of market speculation that allows you to hedge against future price fluctuations or gamble for extraordinary profits.
            *   **Unleash Spells:** Cast **Spells** you have researched to directly affect other players, their properties, or even the market itself. Spells are typically revealed and their effects resolved immediately, unless stated otherwise on the card. For example, the spell "Cumulonimbus" can be placed on an opponent's land to hinder their production.
            *   **Brew and Deploy Potions:** Use the required ingredients listed to create **Potions** from the recipes you have researched. Potions are placed face down, either in front of you or under a property (depending on the potion's stipulations), and act as hidden boons. They are revealed and their effects activated when the specific conditions described on the card are met. For instance, "Raining Gold" can be placed on a Land, and when that land's number is rolled, you might receive extra gold. Similarly, "Golem better nature" is placed on a Specialized Property and can potentially deactivate an attacking Golem.

        *   **C. Military Might (Golems and Royal Guard):**
            *   **Animate Golems:** Bring your **Golems** to life, sacrificing **Souls** and rolling dice to determine their strength. Deploy these magical constructs to attack or defend properties, or to utilize their special abilities.
            *   **Motivate Royal Guards:** Recruit powerful human warriors, the **Royal Guard**, by paying their substantial gold cost. Roll dice to determine their prowess, and deploy them strategically to protect your interests or enact your will upon the marketplace.

> [!NOTE]
> In these early turns, focus on establishing a solid economic foundation. Acquire properties, generate resources, and carefully consider your investments. The path to becoming a master merchant-mage is long and fraught with challenges, but with cunning and foresight, you can rise to the top.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Clarity is key in the magical marketplace. *Declare your actions clearly and ensure all players are aware of your moves.* This transparency fosters fair play and allows your rivals to react accordingly.
# The Cards of Commerce and Conjuring
> *"In the grand bazaars of the Spellbound Realm, fortunes are made not just with magic, but with the careful play of cards both mundane and mystical."* - Chapter I, "Observations on Merchants," from *Merlin's Merchant Manual*

> [!NOTE]
> Playing Cards
> While common folk might use these cards for simple games of chance, merchant-mages know them as powerful tools of magical commerce. Each card represents contracts, deeds, and permits sanctioned by the **Grand Merchant Council**.

## ð° Properties and Permits (2-6, 8-10)
> [!NOTE]
> All permits cost the current **Cost of the Living** to acquire from the Council's offices.

#### â£ï¸ Clubs: Properties and Holdings
*The foundation of any respectable merchant-mage's empire*

Properties represent magically-attuned real estate, each with its own economic character. Each property is numbered reflecting its statistical probability of a dice roll. When the dice roll matches the number of a property you own, you receive gold. The **Payout Rate** indicates the amount of gold you receive when this happens, representing the profit margin of that particular establishment.

| Card Number | Payout Rate | Location Type                                                          |
| ----------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 2, 3        | 5, 4 gold   | *Rare but highly profitable mystic bazaars and enchanted marketplaces* |
| 4, 10       | 3 gold      | *Reliable merchant quarters with steady customer flow*                 |
| 5, 9        | 2 gold      | *Popular trading posts with higher operating costs*                    |
| 6, 8        | 1 gold      | *Busy markets with thin margins but frequent business*                 |

> [!TIP]
> While properties with higher numbers (like 6 and 8) are statistically more likely to trigger during dice rolls, they represent bustling markets with high overhead costs, resulting in smaller gold payouts, or a thinner profit margin. Conversely, the rarer low-number properties (2 and 3) are more exclusive magical venues that generate higher gold payouts per trigger, offering a more robust profit margin.
##### Chauffeurs: Magical Financial Institutions
*The ancient wizards of old discovered the power of aligning magical energies to not only create power, but to keep their gold safe. The result? Chauffeurs, sophisticated magical banks.*

When two properties are magically aligned (**placed perpendicularly** on top of each other), they form a **Chauffeur** - your own personal magical vault. A Chauffeur is more than just a place to store your gold; it's a hub for your financial machinations, a place where you can weave spells of finance.

**Chauffeur Mechanics:**
*   **Secure Vault:** Gold nestled within your Chauffeur is safe from prying eyes and the effects of disastrous events (like losing investments on a roll of 7). Think of it as "managed" wealth rather than loose change.
*   **Lending Magic:** Your Chauffeur allows you to lend gold to fellow merchant-mages, setting your own interest rates. Will you be a generous benefactor or a shrewd moneylender?
*   **Arcane Derivatives:** The magic within your Chauffeur enables you to craft and trade complex derivative contracts, hedging against risk or gambling for great riches. All Chauffeurs can create derivatives regardless of their property value.
*   **Private Mint:** Dare to issue your own bonds, stocks, or even a unique currency, backed by the magical energies of your assets. Become the master of your own financial realm.
*   **Passive Resonance:** When the dice roll matches the numbers of *any two* properties that form your Chauffeur, it resonates, generating one gold for every five gold tucked away inside. This is an extra source of income for the savvy mage. Note, this does not trigger when each number is individually rolled.
*   **Golem Ward:** No pesky Golems can directly attack your Chauffeur. Your gold is safe and sound, protected by ancient magic.

**Creating a Chauffeur:**
*   Choose two **un-invested** properties you own.
*   Place one card sideways on top of the other, binding their energies.
*   On your turn, move gold freely from your personal reserves to the vault of your Chauffeur.
*   Properties with Permits (Lands, Spell Shops, Breweries, etc.) on top cannot become a part of a Chauffeur.

> [!WARNING]
> Chauffeurs have no set limits or requirements. This power is in your hands, but great power comes with great risk. A poorly managed Chauffeur can lead to your financial undoing. Use your wisdom, merchant-mage, and plan carefully.

### â ï¸ Spades: Spell Labs and Arcane Research
*Where the pursuit of magical knowledge meets the harsh realities of economic necessity.*

Spades represent magical laboratories dedicated to the creation of spells. These labs require consistent funding, but they allow the production of powerful spells to use against other players.

##### Spell Labs: The Heart of Arcane Innovation
A Spell Lab is where you channel your resources into arcane research, hoping to unlock new spells. Each lab is represented by a Spade card.

**Spell Lab Mechanics:**
*   **Research Funding:** To begin research, you must fund your Spell Lab with **research grants**. This is done by paying the current **Research Cost** to the Central Bank.
*   **Spell Generation:** When the dice roll matches the number on your Spell Lab card, you generate a **Spell Card**. This card is drawn from the Spell Deck.
*  **Research Success:** A Spell Lab is considered successful after it has produced **3 spent spell cards**, indicated by placing the spent spell card upside down beneath the lab card. These spent spell cards are reshuffled into the deck when a Spell Shop is created.
*   **Research Grants and Central Bank:** When your Spell Lab generates a Spell Card, the research funds previously paid are given to the Central Bank, symbolizing the expense of arcane research.
*   **Spells**: Spells negatively affect other players and their resources.

##### Spell Shops: The Bazaar of Enchantments
When a funded and successful Spell Lab is combined with a property, it is converted into a Spell Shop, a place where spells can be traded.

**Spell Shop Mechanics:**
*   **Creation:** To create a Spell Shop, place the successful Spell Lab card perpendicularly on top of any owned property. Reshuffle all spent spell cards under the lab back into the deck. The research funds given to the Central Bank.
*   **Spell Sales:** A Spell Shop grants you the ability to sell spell cards to the Central Bank or to other players.
*   **Brokerage Services:** On their turn, other players can use your Spell Shop to sell their spells to the Central Bank or other players, but this is not an obligation.
*  **Property Maintenance:** Instead of generating spell cards, a Spell Shop requires maintenance payments when its number is rolled. This is an operational cost to keep the business running.
*  **Maintenance Costs:** Maintenance costs start at one gold, but can fluctuate depending on various game factors. These are always paid to the Central Bank.
*  **Investments**: Spell shops can be invested in by placing gold on top of it.

**Using Spells:**
*   Spells can be used at any point during your turn, unless the card states otherwise.
*   Spells are played by revealing the card and stating which player or property it is targeting.
*   Once used, a spell card is either placed face down under the lab that created it to track research progression, or reshuffled back into the deck if the spell did not come from that lab.

> [!NOTE]
> Strategic use of spells can cripple your opponents' economies, but over reliance can be costly if your spell shops can't keep up with maintenance.

---
### â¥ï¸ Hearts: Potion Labs and Alchemical Concoctions
*Where the mysteries of alchemy blend with the pragmatic demands of the marketplace.*

Hearts represent potion laboratories, where you can create beneficial potions that can buff yourself and your resources. These labs need funding just like their spell-slinging cousins but instead focus on providing direct, if temporary, benefits to players.

##### Potion Labs: The Crucible of Elixirs
A Potion Lab is where you combine research and resources to create potions with unique effects. Each lab is represented by a Heart card.

**Potion Lab Mechanics:**
*   **Research Funding:** Just like Spell Labs, you must fund your Potion Lab with **research grants**. This is done by paying the current **Research Cost** to the Central Bank.
*   **Potion Recipe Generation:** When the dice roll matches the number on your Potion Lab card, you generate a **Potion Recipe Card**. This card is drawn from the Potion Deck.
*   **Research Success:** A Potion Lab is considered successful once it has produced **3 spent potion recipe cards**, indicated by placing the spent recipe card upside down beneath the lab card. These spent recipe cards are reshuffled into the deck when a Brewery is created.
*   **Research Grants and Central Bank:** When your Potion Lab generates a Potion Recipe Card, the research funds previously paid are given to the Central Bank, symbolizing the cost of alchemical discovery.
*   **Potions**: Potions apply buffs to the player, improving some aspect of the game

##### Breweries: The Source of Enchanted Brews
When a funded and successful Potion Lab is combined with a property, it transforms into a Brewery, a place to convert resources into a valuable commodity.

**Brewery Mechanics:**
*   **Creation:** To create a Brewery, place the successful Potion Lab card perpendicularly on top of any owned property. Reshuffle all spent recipe cards under the lab back into the deck. The research funds are given to the Central Bank.
*   **Mead Production:** A Brewery allows you to convert a hand of two **Essence Grain** into Mead, which can be sold to the Central Bank or other players for the current **Cost of the Living**.
*  **Property Maintenance:** Instead of generating potion recipe cards, a Brewery requires maintenance payments when its number is rolled. This is an operational cost to keep the business running.
*  **Maintenance Costs:** Maintenance costs start at one gold, but can fluctuate depending on various game factors. These are always paid to the Central Bank.
*   **Investments:** Breweries cannot be invested in
*   **"Last Call":** If a player has an unoccupied Brewery, they can activate the "Last Call" ability. This allows them to instantly recall one of their Royal Guards to the Brewery at the cost of one **Mead**. This can be a powerful way to quickly redeploy a Royal Guard to a more strategic location or to save them from a losing battle.

> [!NOTE]
> The "Last Call" ability can only be used on a player's turn and only if they have an unoccupied Brewery. The recalled Royal Guard is immediately placed on the Brewery, and any ongoing combat involving that unit is immediately ended. The Royal Guard cannot be placed on a Brewery that already has a defending Golem or Royal Guard.

**Using Potions:**
*   To use a potion, you must have the necessary resources that the recipe requires.
*   The Potion Recipe card must be revealed before the card's abilities play out.
*   Potions are played by placing them face down under a property to affect it or face down in front of you if it affects you directly.
*   Once used, a potion card is reshuffled into the deck, discarding the commodities to the commodity deck.

> [!NOTE]
> Proper resource management and planning are required to ensure you have enough commodities to use your potions.---

### â¦ï¸ Diamonds: Lands and the Bounty of Nature
*The very foundation of the magical economy, where raw materials are harvested from the earth. Yet, moving those resources through the arcane pathways of the realm is a challenge, even for the most accomplished wizard.*

Diamonds represent the land cards, which are the sources of the three essential commodities that fuel all magical creation and trade. These cards, when placed atop properties, yield vital resources when their corresponding number is rolled. However, merely producing commodities is not enough; one must also be capable of delivering them to the markets.

#### Land Cards: The Source of Raw Materials

Each Land card represents a specific type of resource-rich land:

*   **Placement:** Land cards can only be placed on top of unoccupied properties that have not been invested in.
*   **Resource Generation:** When the dice roll matches the number on a Land card you own, you generate the corresponding commodity:
    *   **2, 3, 4:** Souls
    *   **5, 6:** Elixir Oil
    *   **8, 9, 10:** Essence Grain
*   **Planting Commodities:** You can place the commodity that a Land card produces on the Land Card. When this Land card's number is rolled, it produces *double* the normal amount of that commodity. Note that this only applies to Souls and Essence Grain, and the planted commodity is not doubled.
*   **Investment Restriction:** Neither the Land card nor the property underneath it can be invested in.

#### Commodities: The Essence of Trade

*   **Souls:** The essence of life and magic, used to animate Golems and trade for magical components.
*   **Elixir Oil:** A rare and potent substance used for magical enhancements and creating complex potions.
*   **Essence Grain:** A staple ingredient used to brew potions and produce mead.

#### Commodity Storage and Visibility

*All produced commodities are stored in front of the player, on the table for all players to see.*

*   Players cannot conceal how many commodities they own from other players.

#### Commodity Transport: The Legacy of Ancient Magic

*In the earliest days of the realm, wizards discovered transportation spells to send commodities and money across vast distances. These spells, refined over centuries for efficiency, allow for almost instantaneous delivery. However, there is a catch: the original spells are so old, so fundamentally simple, they now require a physical medium - horse and cart - to function. This is why even the most powerful wizards are stuck with horse carts for transportation.*

*   **Base Transport: Horse Cart**
    *   When you want to sell commodities at the market, they are loaded onto a horse-drawn cart for transport.
    *   **Risk:** When a **7** is rolled, any commodities being transported are at risk of breakdown. Players must roll a d6 for each cart they send out. On a roll of 1-3, the cart is considered to be broken down, and the commodity is lost. Lost commodities are returned to the respective commodity deck.
    *   **Transport Action:** A player may only transport commodities once per turn.
* **Trading between Players:** To facilitate a healthy market, trading between players is encouraged.
	*   When trading with others for commodities and other items that can be traded on the market, a D6 is rolled by both players to determine if the paths between kingdoms is safe.
    *   If either player rolls a three or below the cart with all of their items are stolen and reshuffled into the deck.
    *   If the trading partners have ever targeted each other with spells, then this also happens when a two is rolled.
* **Transport Spells:** Powerful spells that increase efficiency and reduce transport risk will be available through the spell deck.

## The Animated Guardians: Golems of War and Warding

> *"The true power of a golem lies not just in its strength, but in the ingenuity of its master. Bind your golems with the right resources, and they will be instruments of unmatched might.â* - *Grand Artificer Lyra's Notes on Golem Creation*

When the markets grow volatile, or rivalries deepen, the time may come to animate the Golems and call upon the Royal Guard. These constructs of magic and might are not mere brutes, but strategic tools, each with its own unique role on the battlefield and in the marketplace. They require time and specific resources to unleash their full potential.

### Animating a Golem

To bring a Golem to life, a merchant-mage must:

1. Sacrifice one **Soul** to the commodity deck
2. Roll two D6:

    *   First roll determines **Attack Power** (1-6)
    *   Second roll determines **Hit Points** (1-6)
3. The Golem becomes active on your next turn

### Golem Alignments

The suit of the card determines the Golem's natural inclination:

*   **Black Cards** (Spades, Clubs) â Aggressive Golems

    *   *Specialized in attacking properties and disrupting commerce*
*   **Red Cards** (Hearts, Diamonds) â Defensive Golems

    *   *Excel at protecting properties and maintaining order*

### Basic Golem Actions

During your action phase, each active Golem may perform **ONE** of the following:

*   **Attack:** A Golem can attack an opponent's property or an opponent's Golem.

    *   When attacking a **property**, the Golem deals damage equal to its **Attack Power**. If the property is defended by a Golem, the attacking Golem's damage is first applied to the defending Golem's **Hit Points**. Any excess damage is then applied to the property.
    *   When attacking another **Golem**, both Golems deal damage to each other equal to their respective **Attack Powers**.
*   **Defend:** A Golem can defend one of your properties.

    *   A defending Golem acts as a shield for the property. Any attacks directed at the property must first deplete the defending Golem's **Hit Points** before affecting the property itself.
    *   A Golem can only defend one property at a time.
*   **Use Special Ability:** A Golem can use its unique special ability, as detailed in its description. These abilities often require specific commodities to activate.
*   **Movement:** A Golem can move up to one space (one property) to an adjacent property.
    *   **Restriction:** Golems cannot move through properties occupied by enemy Golems. They must either attack the enemy Golem or choose a different path.
    *   **Adjacency:** Properties are considered adjacent if their cards are physically touching, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
    *   **Exception:** Golems cannot be placed or moved onto a Chauffeur. They may move past it to an adjacent property, if available.

### ð¿ Stone Sentinels (Jacks)

*"A Golem is but shaped stone, until given purpose by a will of iron and a heart of fire." -* Attributed to Eldric the Golemwright, from the lost *"Annals of the Animate Earth"*

Stone Sentinels, the stalwart Jacks of the Golem hierarchy, are the most common and adaptable of their kind. Each suit represents a different facet of their ancient design, granting them unique abilities on the battlefield.

> [!NOTE]
> All Stone Sentinels have a base Attack Power determined by the first D6 roll when animated, and base Hit Points determined by the second D6 roll.
### â Bronze Guardians (Queens)

*"A Queen's strength is not in her own power, but in her ability to orchestrate the might of others. She is the conductor of the symphony of war, the weaver of the tapestry of fate." - *Excerpt from "The Queen's Gambit: Strategies of Court and Conquest"*

Bronze Guardians, the regal commanders of the Golem forces, are masters of strategy and manipulation. They are not mere fighters, but leaders who can bolster allies, disrupt enemies, and even sacrifice themselves for the greater good. Each suit represents a different aspect of their royal authority, granting them unique powers on the battlefield.

> [!NOTE]
> All Bronze Guardians have a base Attack Power determined by the first D6 roll when animated, and base Hit Points determined by the second D6 roll.

## The Royal Guard: Champions of the Crown (Kings)

*"They are not mere soldiers, but paragons of virtue, each a living embodiment of the Crown's authority. To command them is a privilege, to witness their might, an honor." - *From the Royal Chronicles of the Merchant-Mage Council*

The Royal Guard are champions of the Crown, elite warriors sworn to serve the ruling merchant-mage. They are not Golems, crafted from stone and magic, but humans, highly trained and fiercely loyal. Each member of the Royal Guard embodies a different aspect of royal authority, from unwavering defense to swift and decisive offense. Their abilities are fueled by the very gold they are sworn to protect, making their service a significant investment.

> [!NOTE]
> All Royal Guards have a base **Strength** determined by the sum of two D6 rolls when **motivated**, and base **Health** determined by the sum of two D6 rolls.

### Motivating the Royal Guard

To inspire a Royal Guard to join the fray, a merchant-mage must:

1. Pay the **Motivation Cost** of **3 + the current Cost of the Living** in gold to the Central Bank. This represents the substantial investment required to secure the service of these elite warriors.
2. Roll **four D6**:
    *   First **two** dice determine **Strength** (2-12)
    *   Second **two** dice determine **Health** (2-12)
3. The Royal Guard becomes active on the same turn they are motivated if the player pays an additional 2 gold. Otherwise, they become active on the player's next turn.
4. Only one Royal Guard may be on the field at a time.

### Royal Guard Special Abilities

Each member of the Royal Guard possesses a unique special ability that can be activated *once* upon being played. Activating these abilities directly impacts the **Cost of the Living** counter, reflecting the economic strain of employing such powerful individuals. After using their ability, the Royal Guard is placed on any property, where they remain as a defending force until defeated. **Royal Guards cannot be placed on Chauffeurs.**

### Royal Decrees

*   When a King is drawn, it **must** be played immediately.
*   The player drawing the King has the honor of choosing a **Royal Decree** card from the Royal Decree deck.
*   These decrees are disguised as beneficial pronouncements but often carry hidden, often detrimental consequences for the player who enacts them. However, they also award the player with a coveted **Crown**, a symbol of royal favor and a step towards victory.
*   **Refusal of Decree:** If the player who drew the King does not wish to enact the chosen Royal Decree, a bidding system is initiated. Players can bid gold to take on the decree, with the highest bidder receiving the Crown and the consequences. The bid is split between the Central Bank and the player who originally drew the King.

> [!NOTE]
> Royal Decrees add an element of risk and political maneuvering to the game. Will you accept the Crown's "generosity" and risk the consequences, or will you let another player take the fall in your quest for economic dominance?

## The Art of War: Golem and Royal Guard Combat

> *"When the markets fail, and diplomacy crumbles, it is the clash of stone and steel that dictates the fate of empires." -* Chapter VII, "The Economics of Warfare," from *Merlin's Merchant Manual*

In the realm of Merlin Economics, battles are not merely about brute force, but about strategic deployment, calculated risk, and the cunning use of resources. Combat is resolved through a combination of dice rolls, special abilities, and tactical maneuvering. This section details the intricacies of combat involving **Golems** and the **Royal Guard**.

### Attacking Properties: Sieges and Conquests

*"A wise merchant-mage knows that true wealth comes not just from trade, but from controlling the very land itself." - *Ancient Proverb of the Merchant-Mage Council*

Properties are the cornerstone of a player's economic engine. Attacking an opponent's property is a strategic move to disrupt their resource generation and cripple their economic growth.
#### Initiating an Attack

1. **Declaration:** On your turn, you may declare an attack with a **Golem** or **Royal Guard** you control.
2. **Target:** Choose an opponent's property as the target of your attack.
3. **Movement:** If the attacking unit is not already on an adjacent property, it must move to an adjacent property before attacking. A unit cannot attack on the same turn it moves, unless stated otherwise.
4. **Golem Limits:** Remember that Golems cannot be placed or moved onto a Chauffeur.

#### Resolving an Attack on a Property

1. **Defense:** If the targeted property is defended by a **Golem** or **Royal Guard**, a battle occurs (see "Golem vs. Golem Combat" and "Royal Guard vs. Golem Combat" below). The defending unit must be defeated before the property can be damaged.
2. **Property Damage:** If the property is undefended, or the defending unit is defeated, the attacking unit deals damage to the property equal to its **Attack Power** (**Strength** for Royal Guards).
3. **Property Hit Points:**
    *   **Standard Properties:** Have 1 Hit Point.
    *   **Permitted Properties:** (Lands, Spell Shops, Breweries) have 2 Hit Points. When hit for the first time, the permit card on top should spin to cover the property underneath. Properties with permits on top that have been hit no longer generate gold on roll, and cannot be invested in.
4. **Destruction:** When a property's Hit Points are reduced to 0, it is considered destroyed.
    *   **Destroyed Standard Property:** The property card is flipped face down. It no longer generates resources or gold.
    *   **Destroyed Permitted Property:** The permit and property card are both flipped face down. They no longer generate resources or gold.
5. **Resource Seizure:** When a property generates a resource and an attacking **Golem** is on the card, instead of the player that owns the property receiving the resource, it is given to the attacking party. If the attacking Golem is defeated before the property generates resources, the defending player retains control of the property and any resources generated.
6. **Entrenchment:** A property with both an attacking and defending **Golem** are considered entrenched. When entrenched, roll a d6. On a roll of 1-3, the property generates a resource as normal. On a roll of 4-6, the property does not generate a resource that turn.

### Golem vs. Golem Combat: Clashes of Animated Stone

*"Let the earth tremble and the sparks fly as these titans of stone and magic collide. Their battles are a spectacle of raw power, a testament to the might of their creators." - *From "The Golem Wars: A Chronicle of the Animated Conflicts"*

When Golems clash, it's a battle of brute force, special abilities, and strategic positioning.

#### Combat Sequence

1. **Simultaneous Attack:** Both the attacking and defending Golems deal damage to each other simultaneously. The damage dealt is equal to their respective **Attack Powers**.
2. **Special Abilities:** Players can activate their Golems' special abilities during combat, following the costs and conditions outlined on their cards.
3. **Damage Resolution:** Golems' **Hit Points** are reduced by the damage received.
4. **Defeat:** When a Golem's Hit Points are reduced to 0, it is defeated and removed from the game.

#### Terrain Effects

Remember that certain card types provide bonuses or penalties to Golems in combat:

*   **Spell Shop:** +1 Attack Power to any attacking Golem.
*   **Brewery:** +1 Hit Point to any defending Golem.
*   **Chauffeur:** No effect. Golems cannot be placed or moved onto a Chauffeur.
*   **Land Cards:** All Golems have -1 to their Attack Power.

#### Suit Synergy and Combination Attacks

Utilize **Suit Synergy** and **Combination Attacks** to gain an edge in Golem combat. Refer to the "The Animated Guardians: Golems of War and Warding" section for details on these advanced tactics.

### Royal Guard vs. Golem Combat: Valor Against Stone

*"Though outnumbered by the tireless Golems, the Royal Guard stand as beacons of hope, their courage and skill a match for any construct of stone and magic." - *Excerpt from "The Ballad of the Royal Guard"*

When a Royal Guard faces a Golem, it's a battle of human skill and determination against unyielding magical constructs.

#### Combat Sequence

1. **Royal Guard Advantage:** Royal Guards, being highly trained warriors, deal damage to the Golem equal to their **Strength** plus 1.
2. **Golem Retaliation:** If the Golem survives the initial attack, it retaliates, dealing damage to the Royal Guard equal to its **Attack Power**.
3. **Special Abilities:** Players can activate their Royal Guard's special ability *once* upon being played. Golems can use their special abilities as normal during combat.
4. **Damage Resolution:** **Health** and **Hit Points** are reduced by the damage received.
5. **Defeat:** When a Royal Guard's Health or a Golem's Hit Points are reduced to 0, they are defeated and removed from the game.

#### Special Considerations

*   **Royal Guard Abilities:** Remember that activating a Royal Guard's special ability affects the **Cost of the Living** counter.
*   **Imposing Colossus:** The Imposing Colossus's **Center of Attention** ability forces Golems to attack it before targeting other units.
*   **Shielding Sovereign:** The Shielding Sovereign cannot use her **Aegis of the Realm** ability to protect a Royal Guard from a Golem's attack.

### Royal Guard vs. Royal Guard Combat: The Clash of Champions

*"When the Royal Guard meet in battle, it is a contest of skill, strategy, and unwavering loyalty. These are the battles that legends are made of, where the fate of the realm hangs in the balance." - *From the "Chronicles of the Crown: Volume III"*

When Royal Guards clash, it's a duel of legendary proportions, a battle that will be etched into the annals of the Merchant-Mage Council.

#### Combat Sequence

1. **Simultaneous Attack:** Both Royal Guards deal damage to each other simultaneously. The damage dealt is equal to their respective **Strengths**.
2. **Special Abilities:** Players can activate their Royal Guard's special ability *once* upon being played.
3. **Damage Resolution:** Royal Guards' **Health** is reduced by the damage received.
4. **Defeat:** When a Royal Guard's Health is reduced to 0, they are defeated and removed from the game.

#### Special Considerations

*   **Imposing Colossus:** The Imposing Colossus's **Center of Attention** ability forces other Royal Guards to attack it before targeting other units.
*   **Shielding Sovereign:** The Shielding Sovereign cannot use her **Aegis of the Realm** ability to protect a Royal Guard from another Royal Guard's attack.

## Taxmen of the Wizard's Republic (Jokers)

*They are the long arm of the Wizard's Republic, the collectors of dues, the enforcers of fiscal policy. When a Taxman enters the game, even the wealthiest merchant-mage feels a chill of apprehension.*

[//]: # (Visual prompt: A stern-faced, official-looking figure in a dark, formal robe, holding a ledger and a quill. They are surrounded by stacks of gold and official documents. Imposing, realistic fantasy art style.)

*   **Appearance:** The Joker cards, if your deck includes them, represent the Taxmen.
*   **Optional Rule:** The inclusion of Jokers is optional, providing a way to adjust the game's pace. Their presence can speed up the game by adding an additional economic drain. All players must unanimously agree to include or exclude Jokers at the beginning of the game.
*   **Effect:** When a Joker, or **Taxman**, is drawn, it is immediately played.
*   **Tax Collection:** Each player must pay an amount of gold equal to the current **Tax Rate** to the **R.O.W.** (Revenue Office of Wizards). This represents the Taxman's duty to collect the Republic's due.
*   **Reshuffle:** After the Taxman has collected the taxes, the Joker is reshuffled back into the deck, ready to reappear and enforce fiscal policy once more.
    *   The collected tax is placed in the **R.O.W.**, *not* the Central Bank.

> [!TIP]
> The presence of Taxmen adds an element of risk to hoarding gold. Be prepared to pay your dues, or consider investing your gold to keep it safe from the Taxman's grasp.

> [!NOTE]
> For more information on the **Tax Rate** and the **R.O.W.**, refer to the "Taxes" section.

## The Sevens of Upheaval (7s): Riding the Waves of Inflation

*The number seven is a fickle force in the realm of magical economics, representing the unpredictable nature of inflation and market instability. When the dice land upon this number, the very foundations of commerce tremble, and even the most seasoned merchant-mages must brace themselves for a shift in the economic winds.*

**When a 7 is rolled on the dice during any player's turn, the following occurs:**

1. **The Cost of Living Rises:** The **Cost of the Living** counter increases by the **Volatility** value (default is 1). This signifies a surge in inflation, impacting the price of goods and services throughout the realm. The **Cost of the Living** can be reduced on unanimous vote during tax season.

2. **Market Instability:** The sudden shift in the economic landscape creates instability in the market:
    *   All gold invested in **properties** is lost and returned to the **Central Bank**. This represents the risks inherent in speculative investments during times of uncertainty.
    *   All commodity holders must pay 1 gold to the **Central Bank** to keep each unit of their commodities. This reflects the increased costs of storage, transportation, and security during inflationary periods.

3. **The Sevens are Unleashed:** If any **7** cards are present in the deck, they are immediately played. This can further disrupt the market and add to the chaos of the moment.

> [!WARNING]
> A roll of 7 can be a devastating blow to even the most prosperous merchant. Fortunes can be wiped out in an instant, and careful planning can be undone by the whims of the market. Be prepared for this eventuality, and consider hedging your risks during times of high volatility. It may be wise to keep some gold in reserve, stored safely in your **Chauffeur**, to weather the storm.

## The Winds of Fortune (Aces): Embracing the Boon of Serendipity

*Aces are wild cards, representing moments of extraordinary luck and unexpected opportunity. When an Ace appears, it's a chance for a windfall, a sudden surge of magical potential that can propel a merchant-mage to new heights of prosperity.*

**When an Ace is drawn from any deck, it must be played immediately:**

1. **A Stroke of Luck:** The player who drew the Ace draws cards from the main deck until a **permit** is revealed. This permit is granted to the player *free of charge*, a boon bestowed by à¦­à¦¾à¦à§à¦¯ itself.
2. **Immediate Activation:** The player immediately receives the benefits of the drawn permit as if they had rolled its corresponding number. They also get to keep the permit, adding it to their holdings and expanding their economic engine.
3. **Reshuffle the Deck:** The Ace is then reshuffled back into the deck, ready to bring another burst of fortune to a lucky merchant-mage.
4. **No Permit Drawn:** If the deck is depleted and no permit is drawn, the deck is reshuffled. The player continues to draw until a permit is revealed.

> [!TIP]
> The appearance of an Ace can dramatically shift the balance of power in the marketplace. Be prepared to capitalize on these moments of fortune, for they can provide a significant advantage in your pursuit of economic dominance. A free permit can be the key to unlocking new strategies and securing your place as a master merchant-mage.

## The Dice of Destiny

*   **Resource Generation:** When a player rolls the dice on their turn, all players check their **properties** and **land** cards. If the number rolled matches the number on any of these cards, the corresponding player receives one of the indicated resources (gold, Souls, Elixir Oil, or Essence Grain).
*   **Seasonal Shifts:** If both dice show the same number (doubles), the **Season Wheel** advances by one portion. This represents the changing seasons and their impact on the magical economy.
    *   The game begins in the first phase of Summer.
    *   Players receive no **Essence Grain** nor **Souls** during Winter.
    *   Players receive double **Essence Grain** and **Souls** during Spring, and fall.
*   **Triggering Events:** Certain dice rolls trigger specific events:
    *   **Rolling a 7:** Increases the **Cost of Research** by one, all invested gold is lost and given to the **Central Bank**, all commodity holders must pay 1 gold to the **Central Bank** to keep their commodities, and all **7** cards are played.
    *   **Rolling an 11 or 12:** Activates specific **Golem** actions noted on their card. **Golems** heal property they are **defending** one hit point.

### The Two Season Wheels: Tracking the Flow of Time and Magic

The Season Wheel is a crucial component for tracking the passage of time and the ebb and flow of magical energies. There are two distinct Season Wheels used in the game, each representing a different state of the magical climate:

#### Standard Season Wheel
*   Used when the **Climate Change** counter is below the threshold indicated in its rules.
*   Represents a balanced magical climate with predictable seasonal effects.
*   Divides the year into four seasons: Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter.

#### Erratic Season Wheel
*   Used when the **Climate Change** counter reaches a specific threshold.
*   Represents an unstable magical climate with unpredictable and often extreme seasonal effects.
*   Features more volatile and potentially dangerous seasonal shifts. The exact effects are detailed on the Erratic Season Wheel itself, but may include:
    *   **Extended Seasons:** Some seasons may last longer than usual.
    *   **Shortened Seasons:** Some seasons may be drastically shortened.
    *   **Intensified Effects:** Seasonal effects may be amplified, both positive and negative.
    *   **Unpredictable Events:** The wheel may trigger unusual magical phenomena.

**Switching Between Wheels:**
*   The game begins with the Standard Season Wheel.
*   As players generate **Oil**, the **Climate Change** counter increases.
*   When the **Climate Change** counter reaches the predetermined threshold, the Standard Season Wheel is replaced with the Erratic Season Wheel.
*   The Erratic Season Wheel remains in play for the rest of the game, or until specific game events dictate a return to the Standard Wheel (if such rules are included in the game).

> [!NOTE]
> For more details on **Golems** and their actions, refer to "The Animated Guardians: Golems of War and Warding" section.

> [!NOTE]
> For more details on **Climate Change** and its effects, refer to the "Indicators" section.

## The Glitter of Gold
*   **Starting Wealth:** Each player begins the game with 10 gold pieces.
*   **Earning Gold:** Gold is primarily earned through **property** ownership. When the dice roll matches a property's number, the owner receives gold based on the property's **Payout Rate**.
*   **Uses of Gold:**
    *   **Property and Permit Acquisition:** Gold is used to purchase **properties** and **permits**.
    *   **Research Funding:** Gold is required to fund **Spell** and **Potion** research.
    *   **Tax Payments:** Gold is used to pay taxes to the **R.O.W.**.
    *   **Investment:** Gold can be invested in **properties**, with the potential for high returns or significant losses.
    *   **Market Transactions:** Gold is used to buy and sell commodities in the **Grand Market**.
    *   **Golem and Royal Guard Activation:** Gold is a crucial component in animating **Golems** and motivating the **Royal Guard**.
*   **Pocket Change:** Any gold that is not invested in a property or stored in a **Chauffeur** is considered "pocket change" and can be vulnerable to loss or theft during certain events, like the roll of a 7.

---

## The Visions of Tomorrow: Future Reading Cards
*   **Types of Future Reading Cards:**
    *   **Tea Leaves:** These cards offer minor insights into potential future events. They are drawn more frequently but have a lower probability of occurring.
    *   **Crystal Balls:** These cards provide more significant predictions with a higher chance of coming to pass.
*   **Drawing a Card:** At the start of each player's turn, one Future Reading card is drawn and revealed.
*   **Event Triggers:** Future Reading cards typically indicate events that will happen under specific conditions, such as a particular number being rolled, a certain number of turns passing, or a specific season occurring. These are described on the card.
*   **Delayed Effects:** Future Reading cards are placed face up on the table after being drawn. They take time to "mature" before their effects are triggered.
*   **Contradictions:** If multiple Future Reading cards predict contradictory events, the card played first takes precedence.
*   **Market Influence:** Some Future Reading cards can influence the market, such as by redistributing **R.O.W.** tax revenue or creating temporary shifts in commodity prices.
*   **Waivers:** Some predictions can be inaccurate, and be waived by adverse rolls foretold on the card.

> [!NOTE]
> If there is not enough gold to be distributed in the manor the card describes to every player, disregard the card.

> [!NOTE]
> For more information on **R.O.W.**, check the Tax section.

## The Arcane Arts of Finance: Mastering Magical Markets

*Beyond the simple bartering of commodities lies a world of complex financial instruments, where fortunes can be multiplied through shrewd investments, calculated risks, and the manipulation of market forces. As a master merchant-mage, you must learn to navigate this intricate landscape, leveraging your wealth and magical prowess to dominate the economic realm.*

### Property Investing: A Gamble with the Fates

*To invest in a property is to tie your fortunes to the very fabric of the magical realm, hoping that the threads of fate will weave a tapestry of prosperity.*

Investing in properties equates to placing gold directly onto a **property** card in your **field**. This is a gamble, a bet that the property's number will be rolled before a 7.

**Mechanics of Property Investment:**

*   Place gold from your personal reserves onto any **unoccupied** property you own (without a Golem or Royal Guard on it).
*   If the property's number is rolled *before* a 7, you **double** your investment. The original investment and the profit are returned to your personal reserves, a bountiful harvest from a well-placed bet.
*   If a 7 is rolled, your investment is **lost**, the gold devoured by the fickle whims of the market. The lost investment is given to the **Central Bank**.
*   You may only invest in a property **once** per turn.
*   Properties with permits (Land, Spell Shops, etc.) **cannot** be invested in. The magical energies of the permit interfere with the delicate threads of fate.

> [!NOTE]
> Property investing is a high-risk, high-reward endeavor. It requires a keen understanding of probability, a healthy dose of luck, and the courage to risk your hard-earned gold.

### The Grand Market: A Crucible of Commodity Trading

*The Grand Market is the beating heart of the magical economy, a place where the raw energies of the realm are transformed into wealth. Here, amidst the cacophony of merchants' cries and the shimmer of magical energies, fortunes are made and lost in the blink of an eye.*

The Grand Market, or simply "the market," is a trading platform for **commodity** speculation. This is where you can buy and sell **Souls**, **Elixir Oil**, and **Essence Grain**, the fundamental elements of magical industry.

**Mechanics of the Grand Market:**

*   **Bid/Ask Tables:** Each commodity has a designated **bid/ask table** in the Central Market area.
*   **Bids:** Players can create **bids** by placing a stack of gold (representing the amount they are willing to pay) on a slip of paper with their name (or identifier) and placing it under the "bid" section of the desired commodity's table. This signifies their intent to buy that commodity at the specified price. Once a bid is in place it cannot be taken out of the market for one turn. To indicate a market exit, a player must shift the bid left into the **escrow** section, in which it can be collect on the players next turn.
    *   Players can shift a bid up same turn, or create more bids with more slips; however, to shift a bid down the difference must also pass escrow.
*   **Asks:** Players can create **asks** by placing a commodity (representing the amount they are willing to sell) on a slip of paper with their name (or identifier) and desired price, and placing it under the "ask" section of that commodity's table. This signifies their intent to sell that commodity at the specified price. An ask can be taken out of the market on the players turn, with no indications necessary.
*   **Executing Trades:** On their turn, players can execute trades by matching a **bid** with an **ask**. The buyer pays the agreed-upon price to the seller, and the commodity changes hands. The trade is recorded, and the market price for that commodity may be affected.
*   **Spot Price:** The **spot price** is considered to be the price halfway between the **bid** and **ask**. If there are no **bids**, the **spot price** is considered zero.
*   **Market Manipulation:** Be warned, there are no regulations against **spoofing**, **short ladders**, or any other cunning (or devious) tactics to manipulate prices. The market is a wild and untamed beast, where the shrewd and the ruthless thrive.
*   **Market Stimulus:** If the market has no **bids** for an item and it has been that way for two months, use **R.O.W** money to create three **bids** at the current **Cost of Living**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> All bids and asks must be **covered**, meaning the buyer must have the gold to back their bid, and the seller must have the commodity to fulfill their ask. There are no trade busts or adjustments in the Grand Market. Once a trade is executed, it is final.

### Commodity Derivatives: Weaving the Future of Fortunes

*For the truly ambitious merchant-mage, the market offers even more sophisticated tools for manipulating wealth: derivatives, contracts that derive their value from the underlying commodities.*

Commodities can be traded, however because it takes time for commodities to grow, contracts can be traded between players to mitigate fluctuating prices. The commodity seller is the **short**, the long is the buyer of commodities. Every contract is calculated using one bushel which is 3 of the same commodity.

**Futures Contracts:**

*   To create a **futures contract** two players need to agree upon:
    *   **Commodity Type:** (Souls, Elixir Oil, or Essence Grain)
    *   **Forward Price:** The price at which the commodity will be exchanged at a future date.
    *   **Expiry Date:** The date on which the contract will be fulfilled.
*   On a sticky note, the **short** must first write their name or any string identifier (e.g farm name, company name) on top. Resource being sold. The forward price. Expiry date in number of years. (e.g Start of summer, Year 3)
*   **Forward Price** can be calculated using a formula, or the shorts gut. But for a rule of thumb it should be the three times whatever the short believes will be the future price of commodity.
*   The sticky note is then placed on the field for players to fulfill by paying the forward price to the short, becoming the **long** on the contract. The long is allowed to sell the contract on their turn for however much they see fit, or hold it until expiry.
*   **Contract Fulfillment:** The contract cannot be assigned until the expiry date. The **short** has an obligation to fulfill all contracts, on their first turn after expiry.
    *   Shorts can buy commodities in the market to fulfill the contract, remove asks on the commodity, or settle the contract by assigning a long contract they hold with the same expiry regardless of forward price. If there are no commodities to buy, the contract can be settled by the last sold price of the commodity.
*   **Failure to Deliver:** If the **short** fails to deliver, the second turn after expiry, the player is considered **bankrupt**.

> [!NOTE]
> For more information on what to do when a player is considered bankrupt refer to the Bankruptcy section.

### Insurance: Hedging Against the Whims of Fate

*Even the most carefully laid plans can be undone by a sudden shift in the winds of fortune. Insurance offers a way to mitigate risk, a safety net against the unpredictable nature of the magical marketplace.*

Players that have a **chauffeurs** that want to be able to hedge against statistical chances in the game are able to create derivatives contracts with other players for a fixed price. A more nuanced version of this is called **insurance**, that relies on seasonal premium changes and leverage.

**Mechanics of Insurance:**

*   **Selling Insurance:** Players can sell **insurance** on statistical chances, essentially creating bets on specific outcomes in the game.
    *   **Simple Example:** "If the next roll is a 2, 3, or 5. Pays 3:1"
    *   **Complex Example:** "If a spell is played to block production of souls on your property and the number on the land is rolled. Pays 14:3"
*   **Insurance Periods:** Insurance periods can be from one turn to multiple years.
*   **Premium Costs:** The cost of the insurance (the **premium**) is negotiated between the buyer and the seller. These can only be changed on the changing of the season.
