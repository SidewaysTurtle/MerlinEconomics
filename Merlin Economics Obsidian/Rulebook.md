## Welcome Letter

Dear Wizard, Witch, or Sentient Newt,

Welcome to Merlin Economics, a simulation of medieval wizard economies adapted from Merlin's seminal work "*Magical Financing 101 and 100 Additional Toad Recipes*". Navigate the complexities of a magical economy through property management, commodity speculation, and economic forecasting.

Whether you're a seasoned merchant-mage or a novice economic enchanter, you'll find yourself deeply engaged in a world where market forces meet magical mayhem.

*- Wizard Sano*

## Overview
Merlin Economics is a strategic economic simulation game for **4-6 players** set in a medieval wizard world. Players simulate a complex wizard economy by managing properties, trading commodities, speculating on markets, and navigating economic uncertainties.

Through careful resource management, market manipulation, and occasional magical mischief, players work to become the dominant economic force in the realm. Success requires mastering multiple aspects of the magical economy - from property development to commodity speculation, from spell research to market manipulation.

> [!TIP]
> First games work best with 4 players and take about 90-120 minutes

### Victory Conditions

### Your First Game of Merlin Economics
*Welcome, aspiring merchant-mage, to your first venture into magical markets and mystical merchandise.*

#### Game Setup
Before delving into the arcane arts of economics, prepare your workspace:

1. Clear a large table space - you'll need room for:
   - Player areas for their **properties** and **cards**
   - Central **market area** for **commodities** 
   - Space for various **tracking wheels** and **counters**

2. Prepare the components:
   - Set up the three tracking devices:

     - **Research Cost Counter** ‚Üí **1**
     - **Cost of Living Counter** ‚Üí **2**
   - Shuffle each deck separately
   - Give each player **10 gold**
   - Create a market space with **bid/ask tables** for:
     - **Souls**
     - **Elixir Oil**
     - **Essence Grain**

> [!TIP]
> A well-organized merchant keeps their resources close and their ledgers closer

#### Starting the Game
As merchant-mages have done for centuries, begin with the traditional **blind auction**:

1. Determine **Turn Order**
   - Each player conceals their bid in a closed fist
   - All reveal simultaneously
   - **Highest bid** becomes first player
   - **Second highest** becomes second player
   - **Third highest** becomes third player
   - **Lowest bid** becomes last player
   - The collected gold is divided:
     - Half goes to the last place merchant
     - Half is stored in **Chauffeurs** for future wealth storage

2. Your First Turn
   - **Cast the dice** to determine resource generation
   - Draw and reveal a **future reading card**
   - Take actions:
     - Buy **properties/permits**
     - Make **investments**
     - Trade **resources**
     - Research **spells/potions**
   
> [!NOTE]
> Focus on building your economic foundation before diving into complex market speculation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Declare your actions clearly - *magic and markets both thrive on clear communication*

# The Cards of Commerce and Conjuring
> *"In the grand bazaars of the Spellbound Realm, fortunes are made not just with magic, but with the careful play of cards both mundane and mystical."* 
> - Merlin's Merchant Manual, Chapter III

## Standard Playing Cards
While common folk might use these cards for simple games of chance, merchant-mages know them as powerful tools of magical commerce. Each card represents contracts, deeds, and permits sanctioned by the **Grand Merchant Council**.

### üè∞ Properties and Permits (2-6, 8-10)
> [!NOTE]
> All permits cost the current **Cost of Living** to acquire from the Council's offices.

#### ‚ô£Ô∏è Clubs: Properties and Holdings
*The foundation of any respectable merchant-mage's empire*

Properties represent magically-attuned real estate, each with its own economic character. Each property is numbered reflecting its statistical probability of a dice roll. When the dice roll matches the number of a property you own, you receive gold. The **Payout Rate** indicates the amount of gold you receive when this happens, representing the profit margin of that particular establishment.

| Card Number | Payout Rate | Location Type                                                          |
| ----------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 2, 3        | 5, 4 gold   | *Rare but highly profitable mystic bazaars and enchanted marketplaces* |
| 4, 10       | 3 gold      | *Reliable merchant quarters with steady customer flow*                 |
| 5, 9        | 2 gold      | *Popular trading posts with higher operating costs*                    |
| 6, 8        | 1 gold      | *Busy markets with thin margins but frequent business*                 |

> [!TIP]
> While properties with higher numbers (like 6 and 8) are statistically more likely to trigger during dice rolls, they represent bustling markets with high overhead costs, resulting in smaller gold payouts, or a thinner profit margin. Conversely, the rarer low-number properties (2 and 3) are more exclusive magical venues that generate higher gold payouts per trigger, offering a more robust profit margin.
##### Chauffeurs: Magical Financial Institutions
*The ancient wizards of old discovered the power of aligning magical energies to not only create power, but to keep their gold safe. The result? Chauffeurs, sophisticated magical banks.*

When two properties are magically aligned (**placed perpendicularly** on top of each other), they form a **Chauffeur** - your own personal magical vault. A Chauffeur is more than just a place to store your gold; it's a hub for your financial machinations, a place where you can weave spells of finance.

**Chauffeur Mechanics:**
*   **Secure Vault:** Gold nestled within your Chauffeur is safe from prying eyes and the effects of disastrous events (like losing investments on a roll of 7). Think of it as "managed" wealth rather than loose change.
*   **Lending Magic:** Your Chauffeur allows you to lend gold to fellow merchant-mages, setting your own interest rates. Will you be a generous benefactor or a shrewd moneylender?
*   **Arcane Derivatives:** The magic within your Chauffeur enables you to craft and trade complex derivative contracts, hedging against risk or gambling for great riches. All Chauffeurs can create derivatives regardless of their property value.
*   **Private Mint:** Dare to issue your own bonds, stocks, or even a unique currency, backed by the magical energies of your assets. Become the master of your own financial realm.
*   **Passive Resonance:** When the dice roll matches the numbers of *any two* properties that form your Chauffeur, it resonates, generating one gold for every five gold tucked away inside. This is an extra source of income for the savvy mage. Note, this does not trigger when each number is individually rolled.
*   **Golem Ward:** No pesky Golems can directly attack your Chauffeur. Your gold is safe and sound, protected by ancient magic.

**Creating a Chauffeur:**
*   Choose two **un-invested** properties you own.
*   Place one card sideways on top of the other, binding their energies.
*   On your turn, move gold freely from your personal reserves to the vault of your Chauffeur.
*   Properties with Permits (Lands, Spell Shops, Breweries, etc.) on top cannot become a part of a Chauffeur.

> [!WARNING]
> Chauffeurs have no set limits or requirements. This power is in your hands, but great power comes with great risk. A poorly managed Chauffeur can lead to your financial undoing. Use your wisdom, merchant-mage, and plan carefully.

### ‚ô†Ô∏è Spades: Spell Labs and Arcane Research
*Where the pursuit of magical knowledge meets the harsh realities of economic necessity.*

Spades represent magical laboratories dedicated to the creation of spells. These labs require consistent funding, but they allow the production of powerful spells to use against other players.

##### Spell Labs: The Heart of Arcane Innovation
A Spell Lab is where you channel your resources into arcane research, hoping to unlock new spells. Each lab is represented by a Spade card.

**Spell Lab Mechanics:**
*   **Research Funding:** To begin research, you must fund your Spell Lab with **research grants**. This is done by paying the current **Research Cost** to the Central Bank.
*   **Spell Generation:** When the dice roll matches the number on your Spell Lab card, you generate a **Spell Card**. This card is drawn from the Spell Deck.
*  **Research Success:** A Spell Lab is considered successful after it has produced **3 spent spell cards**, indicated by placing the spent spell card upside down beneath the lab card. These spent spell cards are reshuffled into the deck when a Spell Shop is created.
*   **Research Grants and Central Bank:** When your Spell Lab generates a Spell Card, the research funds previously paid are given to the Central Bank, symbolizing the expense of arcane research.
*   **Spells**: Spells negatively affect other players and their resources.

##### Spell Shops: The Bazaar of Enchantments
When a funded and successful Spell Lab is combined with a property, it is converted into a Spell Shop, a place where spells can be traded.

**Spell Shop Mechanics:**
*   **Creation:** To create a Spell Shop, place the successful Spell Lab card perpendicularly on top of any owned property. Reshuffle all spent spell cards under the lab back into the deck. The research funds given to the Central Bank.
*   **Spell Sales:** A Spell Shop grants you the ability to sell spell cards to the Central Bank or to other players.
*   **Brokerage Services:** On their turn, other players can use your Spell Shop to sell their spells to the Central Bank or other players, but this is not an obligation.
*  **Property Maintenance:** Instead of generating spell cards, a Spell Shop requires maintenance payments when its number is rolled. This is an operational cost to keep the business running.
*  **Maintenance Costs:** Maintenance costs start at one gold, but can fluctuate depending on various game factors. These are always paid to the Central Bank.
*  **Investments**: Spell shops can be invested in by placing gold on top of it.

**Using Spells:**
*   Spells can be used at any point during your turn, unless the card states otherwise.
*   Spells are played by revealing the card and stating which player or property it is targeting.
*   Once used, a spell card is either placed face down under the lab that created it to track research progression, or reshuffled back into the deck if the spell did not come from that lab.

> [!NOTE]
> Strategic use of spells can cripple your opponents' economies, but over reliance can be costly if your spell shops can't keep up with maintenance.

---
### ‚ô•Ô∏è Hearts: Potion Labs and Alchemical Concoctions
*Where the mysteries of alchemy blend with the pragmatic demands of the marketplace.*

Hearts represent potion laboratories, where you can create beneficial potions that can buff yourself and your resources. These labs need funding just like their spell-slinging cousins but instead focus on providing direct, if temporary, benefits to players.

##### Potion Labs: The Crucible of Elixirs
A Potion Lab is where you combine research and resources to create potions with unique effects. Each lab is represented by a Heart card.

**Potion Lab Mechanics:**
*   **Research Funding:** Just like Spell Labs, you must fund your Potion Lab with **research grants**. This is done by paying the current **Research Cost** to the Central Bank.
*   **Potion Recipe Generation:** When the dice roll matches the number on your Potion Lab card, you generate a **Potion Recipe Card**. This card is drawn from the Potion Deck.
*   **Research Success:** A Potion Lab is considered successful once it has produced **3 spent potion recipe cards**, indicated by placing the spent recipe card upside down beneath the lab card. These spent recipe cards are reshuffled into the deck when a Brewery is created.
*   **Research Grants and Central Bank:** When your Potion Lab generates a Potion Recipe Card, the research funds previously paid are given to the Central Bank, symbolizing the cost of alchemical discovery.
*   **Potions**: Potions apply buffs to the player, improving some aspect of the game

##### Breweries: The Source of Enchanted Brews
When a funded and successful Potion Lab is combined with a property, it transforms into a Brewery, a place to convert resources into a valuable commodity.

**Brewery Mechanics:**
*   **Creation:** To create a Brewery, place the successful Potion Lab card perpendicularly on top of any owned property. Reshuffle all spent recipe cards under the lab back into the deck. The research funds are given to the Central Bank.
*   **Mead Production:** A Brewery allows you to convert a hand of two **Essence Grain** into Mead, which can be sold to the Central Bank or other players for the current **Cost of Living**.
*  **Property Maintenance:** Instead of generating potion recipe cards, a Brewery requires maintenance payments when its number is rolled. This is an operational cost to keep the business running.
*  **Maintenance Costs:** Maintenance costs start at one gold, but can fluctuate depending on various game factors. These are always paid to the Central Bank.
*   **Investments:** Breweries cannot be invested in

**Using Potions:**
*   To use a potion, you must have the necessary resources that the recipe requires.
*   The Potion Recipe card must be revealed before the card's abilities play out.
*   Potions are played by placing them face down under a property to affect it or face down in front of you if it affects you directly.
*   Once used, a potion card is reshuffled into the deck, discarding the commodities to the commodity deck.

> [!NOTE]
> Proper resource management and planning are required to ensure you have enough commodities to use your potions.---

### ‚ô¶Ô∏è Diamonds: Lands and the Bounty of Nature
*The very foundation of the magical economy, where raw materials are harvested from the earth. Yet, moving those resources through the arcane pathways of the realm is a challenge, even for the most accomplished wizard.*

Diamonds represent the land cards, which are the sources of the three essential commodities that fuel all magical creation and trade. These cards, when placed atop properties, yield vital resources when their corresponding number is rolled. However, merely producing commodities is not enough; one must also be capable of delivering them to the markets.

#### Land Cards: The Source of Raw Materials

Each Land card represents a specific type of resource-rich land:

*   **Placement:** Land cards can only be placed on top of unoccupied properties that have not been invested in.
*   **Resource Generation:** When the dice roll matches the number on a Land card you own, you generate the corresponding commodity:
    *   **2, 3, 4:** Souls
    *   **5, 6:** Elixir Oil
    *   **8, 9, 10:** Essence Grain
*   **Planting Commodities:** You can place the commodity that a Land card produces on the Land Card. When this Land card's number is rolled, it produces *double* the normal amount of that commodity. Note that this only applies to Souls and Essence Grain, and the planted commodity is not doubled.
*   **Investment Restriction:** Neither the Land card nor the property underneath it can be invested in.

#### Commodities: The Essence of Trade

*   **Souls:** The essence of life and magic, used to animate Golems and trade for magical components.
*   **Elixir Oil:** A rare and potent substance used for magical enhancements and creating complex potions.
*   **Essence Grain:** A staple ingredient used to brew potions and produce mead.

#### Commodity Storage and Visibility

*All produced commodities are stored in front of the player, on the table for all players to see.*

*   Players cannot conceal how many commodities they own from other players.

#### Commodity Transport: The Legacy of Ancient Magic

*In the earliest days of the realm, wizards discovered transportation spells to send commodities and money across vast distances. These spells, refined over centuries for efficiency, allow for almost instantaneous delivery. However, there is a catch: the original spells are so old, so fundamentally simple, they now require a physical medium - horse and cart - to function. This is why even the most powerful wizards are stuck with horse carts for transportation.*

*   **Base Transport: Horse Cart**
    *   When you want to sell commodities at the market, they are loaded onto a horse-drawn cart for transport.
    *   **Risk:** When a **7** is rolled, any commodities being transported are at risk of breakdown. Players must roll a d6 for each cart they send out. On a roll of 1-3, the cart is considered to be broken down, and the commodity is lost. Lost commodities are returned to the respective commodity deck.
    *   **Transport Action:** A player may only transport commodities once per turn.
* **Trading between Players:** To facilitate a healthy market, trading between players is encouraged.
	*   When trading with others for commodities and other items that can be traded on the market, a D6 is rolled by both players to determine if the paths between kingdoms is safe.
    *   If either player rolls a three or below the cart with all of their items are stolen and reshuffled into the deck.
    *   If the trading partners have ever targeted each other with spells, then this also happens when a two is rolled.
* **Transport Spells:** Powerful spells that increase efficiency and reduce transport risk will be available through the spell deck.

## The Animated Guardians: Golems of War and Warding

> *"The true power of a golem lies not just in its strength, but in the ingenuity of its master. Bind your golems with the right resources, and they will be instruments of unmatched might.‚Äù* - *Grand Artificer Lyra's Notes on Golem Creation*

When the markets grow volatile, or rivalries deepen, the time may come to animate the Golems and call upon the Royal Guard. These constructs of magic and might are not mere brutes, but strategic tools, each with its own unique role on the battlefield and in the marketplace. They require time and specific resources to unleash their full potential.

### Animating a Golem

To bring a Golem to life, a merchant-mage must:

1. Sacrifice one **Soul** to the commodity deck
2. Roll two D6:
    *   First roll determines **Attack Power** (1-6)
    *   Second roll determines **Hit Points** (1-6)
3. The Golem becomes active on your next turn

### Golem Alignments

The suit of the card determines the Golem's natural inclination:

*   **Black Cards** (Spades, Clubs) ‚Üí Aggressive Golems
    *   *Specialized in attacking properties and disrupting commerce*
*   **Red Cards** (Hearts, Diamonds) ‚Üí Defensive Golems
    *   *Excel at protecting properties and maintaining order*

### Basic Golem Actions

During your action phase, each active Golem may perform **ONE** of the following:

*   **Attack:** A Golem can attack an opponent's property or an opponent's Golem.
    *   When attacking a **property**, the Golem deals damage equal to its **Attack Power**. If the property is defended by a Golem, the attacking Golem's damage is first applied to the defending Golem's **Hit Points**. Any excess damage is then applied to the property.
    *   When attacking another **Golem**, both Golems deal damage to each other equal to their respective **Attack Powers**.
*   **Defend:** A Golem can defend one of your properties.
    *   A defending Golem acts as a shield for the property. Any attacks directed at the property must first deplete the defending Golem's **Hit Points** before affecting the property itself.
    *   A Golem can only defend one property at a time.
*   **Use Special Ability:** A Golem can use its unique special ability, as detailed in its description. These abilities often require specific commodities to activate.

## üóø Stone Sentinels (Jacks)

*"A Golem is but shaped stone, until given purpose by a will of iron and a heart of fire." - *Attributed to Eldric the Golemwright, from the lost "Annals of the Animate Earth"*

Stone Sentinels, the stalwart Jacks of the Golem hierarchy, are the most common and adaptable of their kind. Each suit represents a different facet of their ancient design, granting them unique abilities on the battlefield.

> [!NOTE]
> All Stone Sentinels have a base Attack Power determined by the first D6 roll when animated, and base Hit Points determined by the second D6 roll.

### ‚ô£Ô∏è The Overly Eager Sentinel (Jack of Clubs)

*A maelstrom of unbridled aggression, this Golem is a whirlwind of stone and fury, ever eager to leap into the fray.*

[//]: # (Visual prompt: A muscular humanoid golem made of rough, dark stone, charging forward with glowing green cracks in its body, one fist raised, in a dynamic action pose. Impressionistic, fantasy art style.)

**Special Ability: Impetuous Assault**

*   **Cost:** 1 Soul
*   **Effect:**
    *   This eager construct can attack on the same turn it is animated, a testament to its raw power.
    *   However, its eagerness comes at a cost, as it cannot defend properties.
    *   *This Sentinel is perfect for swift, decisive strikes but is vulnerable to counterattacks.*
*   If a Stone Sentinel is animated on a turn where an 11 is rolled, and this ability is activated, the attack is doubled, a furious onslaught.

> [!TIP]
> Unleash the Overly Eager Sentinel to quickly cripple your opponent's properties, but be prepared for its defensive shortcomings. Keep a watchful eye, for its impetuous nature can be its undoing.

### ‚ô†Ô∏è The Harmonious Sentinel (Jack of Spades)

*Forged with a deep connection to its kin, this Sentinel is a master of coordinated warfare, drawing strength from unity and delivering strikes with deadly precision.*

[//]: # (Visual prompt: A sleek, grey stone golem with glowing blue runes etched into its body, standing in a defensive pose with one arm extended, energy connecting it to another nearby golem. Stylized, fantasy art style.)

**Special Ability: Coordinated Strike**

*   **Cost:** 1 Soul, 1 Essence Grain
*   **Effect:**
    *   This Sentinel can combine its attack with that of another friendly Golem, a symphony of stone and force.
    *   Both Golems must target the same property or Golem.
    *   Their combined damage equals the sum of both Golems' Attack Powers, a devastating blow.
    *   Each Golem still receives damage individually, a testament to the risks of even the most coordinated assaults.
    *   *This Sentinel is most effective when used in tandem with other Golems, a true force multiplier.*
*   If a Stone Sentinel is animated on a turn where an 11 is rolled and this ability is activated, the attack is doubled, a perfectly synchronized strike.

> [!TIP]
> Pair the Harmonious Sentinel with another Golem for a devastating combined attack, a dance of destruction that few can withstand.

### ‚ô•Ô∏è The Stalwart Sentinel (Jack of Hearts)

*An unyielding bastion of defense, this Sentinel stands firm against any assault, a steadfast shield protecting those under its charge.*

[//]: # (Visual prompt: A tall, broad-shouldered golem made of smooth, polished white stone with glowing red cracks, standing in a protective stance with a large shield formed from its own arm. Realistic, fantasy art style.)

**Special Ability: Bulwark Stance**

*   **Cost:** 1 Soul, 1 Elixir Oil
*   **Effect:**
    *   The Stalwart Sentinel adds its Hit Points as a shield to the defended property, a bulwark against aggression.
    *   A defending Stalwart Sentinel must be defeated before the property can be damaged, a true guardian.
    *   It can heal 1 damage from the protected property each turn, a testament to its enduring nature.
    *   However, it cannot attack while in Bulwark Stance, its focus solely on defense.
    *   *This Sentinel is ideal for protecting valuable properties, a living fortress.*
*   If a Stone Sentinel is animated on a turn where a 12 is rolled, its hit points are doubled for the turn, an impenetrable wall.

> [!TIP]
> Employ the Stalwart Sentinel to fortify your most profitable properties, making them nigh-impregnable fortresses against your rivals' schemes.

### ‚ô¶Ô∏è The Adaptive Sentinel (Jack of Diamonds)

*A versatile warrior, this Sentinel is a master of improvisation, capable of shifting its focus between offense and defense as the tides of battle demand.*

[//]: # (Visual prompt: A medium-sized, agile-looking golem made of multifaceted, gem-like stone, with glowing yellow energy emanating from its joints, in a balanced stance ready to either attack or defend. Abstract, fantasy art style.)

**Special Ability: Tactical Flexibility**

*   **Cost:** 1 Essence Grain
*   **Effect:**
    *   On the turn it is animated, you can choose to either:
        *   Imbue it with offensive might, adding 1 to its Attack Power until your next turn.
        *   Or bolster its defenses, adding 1 to its Hit Points until your next turn.
    *   *This Sentinel is adaptable to various situations, a jack-of-all-trades on the battlefield.*
*   If a Stone Sentinel is animated on a turn where an 11 or 12 is rolled, this ability costs no commodities, a perfect synchronicity of magic and will.

> [!TIP]
> Utilize the Adaptive Sentinel to fill any role needed on the battlefield, adjusting its strengths to suit your ever-changing strategy. A truly flexible asset in the game of economic warfare.
