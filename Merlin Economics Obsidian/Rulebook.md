## Welcome Letter

Dear Wizard, Witch, or Sentient Newt,

Welcome to Merlin Economics, a simulation of medieval wizard economies adapted from Merlin's seminal work "*Magical Financing 101 and 100 Additional Toad Recipes*". Navigate the complexities of a magical economy through property management, commodity speculation, and economic forecasting.

Whether you're a seasoned merchant-mage or a novice economic enchanter, you'll find yourself deeply engaged in a world where market forces meet magical mayhem.

*- Wizard Sano*

## Overview
Merlin Economics is a strategic economic simulation game for **4-6 players** set in a medieval wizard world. Players simulate a complex wizard economy by managing properties, trading commodities, speculating on markets, and navigating economic uncertainties.

Through careful resource management, market manipulation, and occasional magical mischief, players work to become the dominant economic force in the realm. Success requires mastering multiple aspects of the magical economy - from property development to commodity speculation, from spell research to market manipulation.

> [!TIP]
> First games work best with 4 players and take about 90-120 minutes

### Victory Conditions
*Win through economic domination or royal prestige - bankrupt your rivals or collect crowns while maintaining wealth.*

Players can win through one of two methods:
1. **Economic Dominance**: Bankrupt all other players
2. **Royal Favor**: Collect 5 crowns while having the highest net worth

### Your First Game of Merlin Economics
*Welcome, aspiring merchant-mage, to your first venture into magical markets and mystical merchandise.*

#### Game Setup
Before delving into the arcane arts of economics, prepare your workspace:

1. Clear a large table space - you'll need room for:
   - Player areas for their **properties** and **cards**
   - Central **market area** for **commodities**
   - Space for various **tracking wheels** and **counters**

2. Prepare the components:
   - Set up the three tracking devices:
     - **Season Wheel** ‚Üí '*Start of Summer*'
     - **Research Cost Counter** ‚Üí **1**
     - **Cost of Living Counter** ‚Üí **2**
   - Shuffle each deck separately
   - Give each player **10 gold**
   - Create a market space with **bid/ask tables** for:
     - **Souls**
     - **Elixir Oil**
     - **Essence Grain**

> [!TIP]
> A well-organized merchant keeps their resources close and their ledgers closer

#### Starting the Game
As merchant-mages have done for centuries, begin with the traditional **blind auction**:

1. Determine **Turn Order**
   - Each player conceals their bid in a closed fist
   - All reveal simultaneously
   - **Highest bid** becomes first player
   - **Second highest** becomes second player
   - **Third highest** becomes third player
   - **Lowest bid** becomes last player
   - The collected gold is divided:
     - Half goes to the last place merchant
     - Half is stored in **Chauffeurs** for future wealth storage

2. Your First Turn
   - **Cast the dice** to determine resource generation
   - Draw and reveal a **future reading card**
   - Take actions:
     - Buy **properties/permits**
     - Make **investments**
     - Trade **resources**
     - Research **spells/potions**

> [!NOTE]
> Focus on building your economic foundation before diving into complex market speculation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Declare your actions clearly - *magic and markets both thrive on clear communication*

# The Cards of Commerce and Conjuring
> *"In the grand bazaars of the Spellbound Realm, fortunes are made not just with magic, but with the careful play of cards both mundane and mystical."*
> - Merlin's Merchant Manual, Chapter III

> [!NOTE]
> Playing Cards
> While common folk might use these cards for simple games of chance, merchant-mages know them as powerful tools of magical commerce. Each card represents contracts, deeds, and permits sanctioned by the **Grand Merchant Council**.

## üè∞ Properties and Permits (2-6, 8-10)
> [!NOTE]
> All permits cost the current **Cost of Living** to acquire from the Council's offices.

#### ‚ô£Ô∏è Clubs: Properties and Holdings
*The foundation of any respectable merchant-mage's empire*

Properties represent magically-attuned real estate, each with its own economic character. Each property is numbered reflecting its statistical probability of a dice roll. When the dice roll matches the number of a property you own, you receive gold. The **Payout Rate** indicates the amount of gold you receive when this happens, representing the profit margin of that particular establishment.

| Card Number | Payout Rate | Location Type                                                          |
| ----------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 2, 3        | 5, 4 gold   | *Rare but highly profitable mystic bazaars and enchanted marketplaces* |
| 4, 10       | 3 gold      | *Reliable merchant quarters with steady customer flow*                 |
| 5, 9        | 2 gold      | *Popular trading posts with higher operating costs*                    |
| 6, 8        | 1 gold      | *Busy markets with thin margins but frequent business*                 |

> [!TIP]
> While properties with higher numbers (like 6 and 8) are statistically more likely to trigger during dice rolls, they represent bustling markets with high overhead costs, resulting in smaller gold payouts, or a thinner profit margin. Conversely, the rarer low-number properties (2 and 3) are more exclusive magical venues that generate higher gold payouts per trigger, offering a more robust profit margin.
##### Chauffeurs: Magical Financial Institutions
*The ancient wizards of old discovered the power of aligning magical energies to not only create power, but to keep their gold safe. The result? Chauffeurs, sophisticated magical banks.*

When two properties are magically aligned (**placed perpendicularly** on top of each other), they form a **Chauffeur** - your own personal magical vault. A Chauffeur is more than just a place to store your gold; it's a hub for your financial machinations, a place where you can weave spells of finance.

**Chauffeur Mechanics:**
*   **Secure Vault:** Gold nestled within your Chauffeur is safe from prying eyes and the effects of disastrous events (like losing investments on a roll of 7). Think of it as "managed" wealth rather than loose change.
*   **Lending Magic:** Your Chauffeur allows you to lend gold to fellow merchant-mages, setting your own interest rates. Will you be a generous benefactor or a shrewd moneylender?
*   **Arcane Derivatives:** The magic within your Chauffeur enables you to craft and trade complex derivative contracts, hedging against risk or gambling for great riches. All Chauffeurs can create derivatives regardless of their property value.
*   **Private Mint:** Dare to issue your own bonds, stocks, or even a unique currency, backed by the magical energies of your assets. Become the master of your own financial realm.
*   **Passive Resonance:** When the dice roll matches the numbers of *any two* properties that form your Chauffeur, it resonates, generating one gold for every five gold tucked away inside. This is an extra source of income for the savvy mage. Note, this does not trigger when each number is individually rolled.
*   **Golem Ward:** No pesky Golems can directly attack your Chauffeur. Your gold is safe and sound, protected by ancient magic.

**Creating a Chauffeur:**
*   Choose two **un-invested** properties you own.
*   Place one card sideways on top of the other, binding their energies.
*   On your turn, move gold freely from your personal reserves to the vault of your Chauffeur.
*   Properties with Permits (Lands, Spell Shops, Breweries, etc.) on top cannot become a part of a Chauffeur.

> [!WARNING]
> Chauffeurs have no set limits or requirements. This power is in your hands, but great power comes with great risk. A poorly managed Chauffeur can lead to your financial undoing. Use your wisdom, merchant-mage, and plan carefully.

### ‚ô†Ô∏è Spades: Spell Labs and Arcane Research
*Where the pursuit of magical knowledge meets the harsh realities of economic necessity.*

Spades represent magical laboratories dedicated to the creation of spells. These labs require consistent funding, but they allow the production of powerful spells to use against other players.

##### Spell Labs: The Heart of Arcane Innovation
A Spell Lab is where you channel your resources into arcane research, hoping to unlock new spells. Each lab is represented by a Spade card.

**Spell Lab Mechanics:**
*   **Research Funding:** To begin research, you must fund your Spell Lab with **research grants**. This is done by paying the current **Research Cost** to the Central Bank.
*   **Spell Generation:** When the dice roll matches the number on your Spell Lab card, you generate a **Spell Card**. This card is drawn from the Spell Deck.
*  **Research Success:** A Spell Lab is considered successful after it has produced **3 spent spell cards**, indicated by placing the spent spell card upside down beneath the lab card. These spent spell cards are reshuffled into the deck when a Spell Shop is created.
*   **Research Grants and Central Bank:** When your Spell Lab generates a Spell Card, the research funds previously paid are given to the Central Bank, symbolizing the expense of arcane research.
*   **Spells**: Spells negatively affect other players and their resources.

##### Spell Shops: The Bazaar of Enchantments
When a funded and successful Spell Lab is combined with a property, it is converted into a Spell Shop, a place where spells can be traded.

**Spell Shop Mechanics:**
*   **Creation:** To create a Spell Shop, place the successful Spell Lab card perpendicularly on top of any owned property. Reshuffle all spent spell cards under the lab back into the deck. The research funds given to the Central Bank.
*   **Spell Sales:** A Spell Shop grants you the ability to sell spell cards to the Central Bank or to other players.
*   **Brokerage Services:** On their turn, other players can use your Spell Shop to sell their spells to the Central Bank or other players, but this is not an obligation.
*  **Property Maintenance:** Instead of generating spell cards, a Spell Shop requires maintenance payments when its number is rolled. This is an operational cost to keep the business running.
*  **Maintenance Costs:** Maintenance costs start at one gold, but can fluctuate depending on various game factors. These are always paid to the Central Bank.
*  **Investments**: Spell shops can be invested in by placing gold on top of it.

**Using Spells:**
*   Spells can be used at any point during your turn, unless the card states otherwise.
*   Spells are played by revealing the card and stating which player or property it is targeting.
*   Once used, a spell card is either placed face down under the lab that created it to track research progression, or reshuffled back into the deck if the spell did not come from that lab.

> [!NOTE]
> Strategic use of spells can cripple your opponents' economies, but over reliance can be costly if your spell shops can't keep up with maintenance.

---
### ‚ô•Ô∏è Hearts: Potion Labs and Alchemical Concoctions
*Where the mysteries of alchemy blend with the pragmatic demands of the marketplace.*

Hearts represent potion laboratories, where you can create beneficial potions that can buff yourself and your resources. These labs need funding just like their spell-slinging cousins but instead focus on providing direct, if temporary, benefits to players.

##### Potion Labs: The Crucible of Elixirs
A Potion Lab is where you combine research and resources to create potions with unique effects. Each lab is represented by a Heart card.

**Potion Lab Mechanics:**
*   **Research Funding:** Just like Spell Labs, you must fund your Potion Lab with **research grants**. This is done by paying the current **Research Cost** to the Central Bank.
*   **Potion Recipe Generation:** When the dice roll matches the number on your Potion Lab card, you generate a **Potion Recipe Card**. This card is drawn from the Potion Deck.
*   **Research Success:** A Potion Lab is considered successful once it has produced **3 spent potion recipe cards**, indicated by placing the spent recipe card upside down beneath the lab card. These spent recipe cards are reshuffled into the deck when a Brewery is created.
*   **Research Grants and Central Bank:** When your Potion Lab generates a Potion Recipe Card, the research funds previously paid are given to the Central Bank, symbolizing the cost of alchemical discovery.
*   **Potions**: Potions apply buffs to the player, improving some aspect of the game

##### Breweries: The Source of Enchanted Brews
When a funded and successful Potion Lab is combined with a property, it transforms into a Brewery, a place to convert resources into a valuable commodity.

**Brewery Mechanics:**
*   **Creation:** To create a Brewery, place the successful Potion Lab card perpendicularly on top of any owned property. Reshuffle all spent recipe cards under the lab back into the deck. The research funds are given to the Central Bank.
*   **Mead Production:** A Brewery allows you to convert a hand of two **Essence Grain** into Mead, which can be sold to the Central Bank or other players for the current **Cost of Living**.
*  **Property Maintenance:** Instead of generating potion recipe cards, a Brewery requires maintenance payments when its number is rolled. This is an operational cost to keep the business running.
*  **Maintenance Costs:** Maintenance costs start at one gold, but can fluctuate depending on various game factors. These are always paid to the Central Bank.
*   **Investments:** Breweries cannot be invested in
*   **"Last Call":** If a player has an unoccupied Brewery, they can activate the "Last Call" ability. This allows them to instantly recall one of their Royal Guards to the Brewery at the cost of one **Mead**. This can be a powerful way to quickly redeploy a Royal Guard to a more strategic location or to save them from a losing battle.

> [!NOTE]
> The "Last Call" ability can only be used on a player's turn and only if they have an unoccupied Brewery. The recalled Royal Guard is immediately placed on the Brewery, and any ongoing combat involving that unit is immediately ended. The Royal Guard cannot be placed on a Brewery that already has a defending Golem or Royal Guard.

**Using Potions:**
*   To use a potion, you must have the necessary resources that the recipe requires.
*   The Potion Recipe card must be revealed before the card's abilities play out.
*   Potions are played by placing them face down under a property to affect it or face down in front of you if it affects you directly.
*   Once used, a potion card is reshuffled into the deck, discarding the commodities to the commodity deck.

> [!NOTE]
> Proper resource management and planning are required to ensure you have enough commodities to use your potions.---

### ‚ô¶Ô∏è Diamonds: Lands and the Bounty of Nature
*The very foundation of the magical economy, where raw materials are harvested from the earth. Yet, moving those resources through the arcane pathways of the realm is a challenge, even for the most accomplished wizard.*

Diamonds represent the land cards, which are the sources of the three essential commodities that fuel all magical creation and trade. These cards, when placed atop properties, yield vital resources when their corresponding number is rolled. However, merely producing commodities is not enough; one must also be capable of delivering them to the markets.

#### Land Cards: The Source of Raw Materials

Each Land card represents a specific type of resource-rich land:

*   **Placement:** Land cards can only be placed on top of unoccupied properties that have not been invested in.
*   **Resource Generation:** When the dice roll matches the number on a Land card you own, you generate the corresponding commodity:
    *   **2, 3, 4:** Souls
    *   **5, 6:** Elixir Oil
    *   **8, 9, 10:** Essence Grain
*   **Planting Commodities:** You can place the commodity that a Land card produces on the Land Card. When this Land card's number is rolled, it produces *double* the normal amount of that commodity. Note that this only applies to Souls and Essence Grain, and the planted commodity is not doubled.
*   **Investment Restriction:** Neither the Land card nor the property underneath it can be invested in.

#### Commodities: The Essence of Trade

*   **Souls:** The essence of life and magic, used to animate Golems and trade for magical components.
*   **Elixir Oil:** A rare and potent substance used for magical enhancements and creating complex potions.
*   **Essence Grain:** A staple ingredient used to brew potions and produce mead.

#### Commodity Storage and Visibility

*All produced commodities are stored in front of the player, on the table for all players to see.*

*   Players cannot conceal how many commodities they own from other players.

#### Commodity Transport: The Legacy of Ancient Magic

*In the earliest days of the realm, wizards discovered transportation spells to send commodities and money across vast distances. These spells, refined over centuries for efficiency, allow for almost instantaneous delivery. However, there is a catch: the original spells are so old, so fundamentally simple, they now require a physical medium - horse and cart - to function. This is why even the most powerful wizards are stuck with horse carts for transportation.*

*   **Base Transport: Horse Cart**
    *   When you want to sell commodities at the market, they are loaded onto a horse-drawn cart for transport.
    *   **Risk:** When a **7** is rolled, any commodities being transported are at risk of breakdown. Players must roll a d6 for each cart they send out. On a roll of 1-3, the cart is considered to be broken down, and the commodity is lost. Lost commodities are returned to the respective commodity deck.
    *   **Transport Action:** A player may only transport commodities once per turn.
* **Trading between Players:** To facilitate a healthy market, trading between players is encouraged.
	*   When trading with others for commodities and other items that can be traded on the market, a D6 is rolled by both players to determine if the paths between kingdoms is safe.
    *   If either player rolls a three or below the cart with all of their items are stolen and reshuffled into the deck.
    *   If the trading partners have ever targeted each other with spells, then this also happens when a two is rolled.
* **Transport Spells:** Powerful spells that increase efficiency and reduce transport risk will be available through the spell deck.

## The Animated Guardians: Golems of War and Warding

> *"The true power of a golem lies not just in its strength, but in the ingenuity of its master. Bind your golems with the right resources, and they will be instruments of unmatched might.‚Äù* - *Grand Artificer Lyra's Notes on Golem Creation*

When the markets grow volatile, or rivalries deepen, the time may come to animate the Golems and call upon the Royal Guard. These constructs of magic and might are not mere brutes, but strategic tools, each with its own unique role on the battlefield and in the marketplace. They require time and specific resources to unleash their full potential.

### Animating a Golem

To bring a Golem to life, a merchant-mage must:

1. Sacrifice one **Soul** to the commodity deck
2. Roll two D6:

    *   First roll determines **Attack Power** (1-6)
    *   Second roll determines **Hit Points** (1-6)
3. The Golem becomes active on your next turn

### Golem Alignments

The suit of the card determines the Golem's natural inclination:

*   **Black Cards** (Spades, Clubs) ‚Üí Aggressive Golems

    *   *Specialized in attacking properties and disrupting commerce*
*   **Red Cards** (Hearts, Diamonds) ‚Üí Defensive Golems

    *   *Excel at protecting properties and maintaining order*

### Basic Golem Actions

During your action phase, each active Golem may perform **ONE** of the following:

*   **Attack:** A Golem can attack an opponent's property or an opponent's Golem.

    *   When attacking a **property**, the Golem deals damage equal to its **Attack Power**. If the property is defended by a Golem, the attacking Golem's damage is first applied to the defending Golem's **Hit Points**. Any excess damage is then applied to the property.
    *   When attacking another **Golem**, both Golems deal damage to each other equal to their respective **Attack Powers**.
*   **Defend:** A Golem can defend one of your properties.

    *   A defending Golem acts as a shield for the property. Any attacks directed at the property must first deplete the defending Golem's **Hit Points** before affecting the property itself.
    *   A Golem can only defend one property at a time.
*   **Use Special Ability:** A Golem can use its unique special ability, as detailed in its description. These abilities often require specific commodities to activate.
*   **Movement:** A Golem can move up to one space (one property) to an adjacent property.
    *   **Restriction:** Golems cannot move through properties occupied by enemy Golems. They must either attack the enemy Golem or choose a different path.
    *   **Adjacency:** Properties are considered adjacent if their cards are physically touching, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
    *   **Exception:** Golems cannot be placed or moved onto a Chauffeur. They may move past it to an adjacent property, if available.

### Golem Stacking

*   **Rule:** Multiple Golems *can* occupy the same property.
*   **Maximum Stack:** Up to **two** Golems can stack on a single property.
*   **Benefits:**
    *   **Combined Defense:** When attacking a property with multiple Golems, the attacking Golem must overcome the combined **Hit Points** of all defending Golems.
    *   **Ability Synergy:** Certain Golem abilities may interact or be enhanced when stacked (see Suit Synergy and Combination Attacks below).
*   **Restrictions:**
    *   **Vulnerability:** While stacking provides a defensive advantage, it also makes the stacked Golems more vulnerable to area-of-effect attacks (like those of the Explosive Artillerist).

### Suit Synergy

*   **Rule:** When two Golems of the same suit are either stacked on the same property or are on adjacent properties, they gain a synergy bonus.
*   **‚ô£Ô∏è Clubs (Overly Eager Sentinels):**
    *   **Bonus:** +1 Attack Power to both Golems.
    *   *Represents their shared aggressive nature, bolstering their offensive might.*
*   **‚ô†Ô∏è Spades (Harmonious Sentinels):**
    *   **Bonus:** When performing a Coordinated Strike, add +1 to the total damage.
    *   *Reflects their enhanced coordination and ability to work together seamlessly.*
*   **‚ô•Ô∏è Hearts (Stalwart Sentinels):**
    *   **Bonus:** +1 Hit Point to both Golems.
    *   *Symbolizes their shared resilience and ability to bolster each other's defenses.*
*   **‚ô¶Ô∏è Diamonds (Adaptive Sentinels):**
    *   **Bonus:** When using Tactical Flexibility, add +1 to *either* Attack Power or Hit Points (player's choice).
    *   *Highlights their adaptability and ability to enhance their chosen specialization.*

### Combination Attacks

*   **Rule:** Certain Golem pairings can perform unique Combination Attacks when stacked or on adjacent properties. These attacks are in addition to their individual abilities.
*   **Overly Eager Sentinel (‚ô£Ô∏è) + Explosive Artillerist (‚ô¶Ô∏è):**
    *   **Name:** "Impetuous Bombardment"
    *   **Cost:** 1 Soul, 1 Essence Grain
    *   **Effect:** The Overly Eager Sentinel, in its haste, throws the Explosive Artillerist's bomb immediately upon the Artillerist's activation. The bomb deals +1 damage in addition to its normal effects.
    *   *Illustrates the Overly Eager Sentinel's impulsiveness combined with the Explosive Artillerist's destructive power.*
*   **Harmonious Sentinel (‚ô†Ô∏è) + Shielding Sovereign (‚ô£Ô∏è):**
    *   **Name:** "Coordinated Defense"
    *   **Cost:** 1 Soul, 1 Elixir Oil
    *   **Effect:** The Shielding Sovereign's Aegis of the Realm ability now protects both herself and the Harmonious Sentinel, and the Harmonious Sentinel may still perform a coordinated attack with another Golem.
    *   *Demonstrates their ability to work together to create an impenetrable defense while maintaining offensive capabilities.*
*   **Stalwart Sentinel (‚ô•Ô∏è) + Inspirational Liege (‚ô•Ô∏è):**
    *   **Name:** "Inspiring Bulwark"
    *   **Cost:** 1 Soul, 1 Essence Grain, 1 Elixir Oil
    *   **Effect:** The Inspirational Liege's Royal Boon now grants an additional +1 Hit Point to all friendly Golems, and the Stalwart Sentinel heals the property it's defending by +1.
    *   *Highlights their combined ability to inspire and fortify, creating a powerful defensive synergy.*

### Terrain Effects (Based on Card Type)

*   **Rule:** Certain card types provide bonuses or penalties to Golems occupying them.
*   **Spell Shop:**
    *   **Effect:** +1 Attack Power to any attacking Golem on this property.
    *   *Reflects the volatile magic energies of the Spell Shop, enhancing offensive capabilities.*
*   **Brewery:**
    *   **Effect:** +1 Hit Point to any defending Golem on this property.
    *   *Symbolizes the Brewery's sturdy construction and the invigorating nature of its brews, providing a defensive advantage.*
*   **Chauffeur:**
    *   **Effect:** No bonuses or penalties. Golems cannot be placed or moved onto a Chauffeur.
    *   *Reflects the Chauffeur's unique status as a magically protected financial institution, separate from the battlefield.*
*   **Land Cards:**
    *   **Effect:** All Golems have -1 to their Attack Power.
    *   *Reflects the unrefined nature of these areas, making it more difficult to launch effective attacks.*

### üóø Stone Sentinels (Jacks)

*"A Golem is but shaped stone, until given purpose by a will of iron and a heart of fire." - *Attributed to Eldric the Golemwright, from the lost "Annals of the Animate Earth"*

Stone Sentinels, the stalwart Jacks of the Golem hierarchy, are the most common and adaptable of their kind. Each suit represents a different facet of their ancient design, granting them unique abilities on the battlefield.

> [!NOTE]
> All Stone Sentinels have a base Attack Power determined by the first D6 roll when animated, and base Hit Points determined by the second D6 roll.

#### ‚ô£Ô∏è The Overly Eager Sentinel (Jack of Clubs)

*A maelstrom of unbridled aggression, this Golem is a whirlwind of stone and fury, ever eager to leap into the fray.*

[//]: # (Visual prompt: A muscular humanoid golem made of rough, dark stone, charging forward with glowing green cracks in its body, one fist raised, in a dynamic action pose. Impressionistic, fantasy art style.)

**Special Ability: Impetuous Assault**

*   **Cost:** 1 Soul
*   **Effect:**
    *   This eager construct can attack on the same turn it is animated, a testament to its raw power.
    *   However, its eagerness comes at a cost, as it cannot defend properties.
    *   *This Sentinel is perfect for swift, decisive strikes but is vulnerable to counterattacks.*
*   If a Stone Sentinel is animated on a turn where an 11 is rolled, and this ability is activated, the attack is doubled, a furious onslaught.

> [!TIP]
> Unleash the Overly Eager Sentinel to quickly cripple your opponent's properties, but be prepared for its defensive shortcomings. Keep a watchful eye, for its impetuous nature can be its undoing.

#### ‚ô†Ô∏è The Harmonious Sentinel (Jack of Spades)

*Forged with a deep connection to its kin, this Sentinel is a master of coordinated warfare, drawing strength from unity and delivering strikes with deadly precision.*

[//]: # (Visual prompt: A sleek, grey stone golem with glowing blue runes etched into its body, standing in a defensive pose with one arm extended, energy connecting it to another nearby golem. Stylized, fantasy art style.)

**Special Ability: Coordinated Strike**

*   **Cost:** 1 Soul, 1 Essence Grain
*   **Effect:**
    *   This Sentinel can combine its attack with that of another friendly Golem, a symphony of stone and force.
    *   Both Golems must target the same property or Golem.
    *   Their combined damage equals the sum of both Golems' Attack Powers, a devastating blow.
    *   Each Golem still receives damage individually, a testament to the risks of even the most coordinated assaults.
    *   *This Sentinel is most effective when used in tandem with other Golems, a true force multiplier.*
*   If a Stone Sentinel is animated on a turn where an 11 is rolled and this ability is activated, the attack is doubled, a perfectly synchronized strike.

> [!TIP]
> Pair the Harmonious Sentinel with another Golem for a devastating combined attack, a dance of destruction that few can withstand.

#### ‚ô•Ô∏è The Stalwart Sentinel (Jack of Hearts)

*An unyielding bastion of defense, this Sentinel stands firm against any assault, a steadfast shield protecting those under its charge.*

[//]: # (Visual prompt: A tall, broad-shouldered golem made of smooth, polished white stone with glowing red cracks, standing in a protective stance with a large shield formed from its own arm. Realistic, fantasy art style.)

**Special Ability: Bulwark Stance**

*   **Cost:** 1 Soul, 1 Elixir Oil
*   **Effect:**
    *   The Stalwart Sentinel adds its Hit Points as a shield to the defended property, a bulwark against aggression.
    *   A defending Stalwart Sentinel must be defeated before the property can be damaged, a true guardian.
    *   It can heal 1 damage from the protected property each turn, a testament to its enduring nature.
    *   However, it cannot attack while in Bulwark Stance, its focus solely on defense.
    *   *This Sentinel is ideal for protecting valuable properties, a living fortress.*
*   If a Stone Sentinel is animated on a turn where a 12 is rolled, its hit points are doubled for the turn, an impenetrable wall.
*   **Healing:** If a Stalwart Sentinel ends its turn on a damaged property, it heals that property by 1 Hit Point.

> [!TIP]

## The Royal Guard: Champions of the Crown (Kings)

*"They are not mere soldiers, but paragons of virtue, each a living embodiment of the Crown's authority. To command them is a privilege, to witness their might, an honor." - *From the Royal Chronicles of the Merchant-Mage Council*

The Royal Guard are champions of the Crown, elite warriors sworn to serve the ruling merchant-mage. They are not Golems, crafted from stone and magic, but humans, highly trained and fiercely loyal. Each member of the Royal Guard embodies a different aspect of royal authority, from unwavering defense to swift and decisive offense. Their abilities are fueled by the very gold they are sworn to protect, making their service a significant investment.

> [!NOTE]
> All Royal Guards have a base **Strength** determined by the sum of two D6 rolls when **motivated**, and base **Health** determined by the sum of two D6 rolls.

### Motivating the Royal Guard

To inspire a Royal Guard to join the fray, a merchant-mage must:

1. Pay the **Motivation Cost** of **3 + the current Cost of the Living** in gold to the Central Bank. This represents the substantial investment required to secure the service of these elite warriors.
2. Roll **four D6**:
    *   First **two** dice determine **Strength** (2-12)
    *   Second **two** dice determine **Health** (2-12)
3. The Royal Guard becomes active on the same turn they are motivated if the player pays an additional 2 gold. Otherwise, they become active on the player's next turn.
4. Only one Royal Guard may be on the field at a time.

### Royal Guard Special Abilities

Each member of the Royal Guard possesses a unique special ability that can be activated *once* upon being played. Activating these abilities directly impacts the **Cost of the Living** counter, reflecting the economic strain of employing such powerful individuals. After using their ability, the Royal Guard is placed on any property, where they remain as a defending force until defeated. **Royal Guards cannot be placed on Chauffeurs.**

### Royal Decrees

*   When a King is drawn, it **must** be played immediately.
*   The player drawing the King has the honor of choosing a **Royal Decree** card from the Royal Decree deck.
*   These decrees are disguised as beneficial pronouncements but often carry hidden, often detrimental consequences for the player who enacts them. However, they also award the player with a coveted **Crown**, a symbol of royal favor and a step towards victory.
*   **Refusal of Decree:** If the player who drew the King does not wish to enact the chosen Royal Decree, a bidding system is initiated. Players can bid gold to take on the decree, with the highest bidder receiving the Crown and the consequences. The bid is split between the Central Bank and the player who originally drew the King.

> [!NOTE]
> Royal Decrees add an element of risk and political maneuvering to the game. Will you accept the Crown's "generosity" and risk the consequences, or will you let another player take the fall in your quest for economic dominance?

## The Art of War: Golem and Royal Guard Combat

*"When the markets fail, and diplomacy crumbles, it is the clash of stone and steel that dictates the fate of empires." - *Chapter VII, "The Economics of Warfare," from Merlin's Merchant Manual*

In the realm of Merlin Economics, battles are not merely about brute force, but about strategic deployment, calculated risk, and the cunning use of resources. Combat is resolved through a combination of dice rolls, special abilities, and tactical maneuvering. This section details the intricacies of combat involving **Golems** and the **Royal Guard**.

### Attacking Properties: Sieges and Conquests

*"A wise merchant-mage knows that true wealth comes not just from trade, but from controlling the very land itself." - *Ancient Proverb of the Merchant-Mage Council*

Properties are the cornerstone of a player's economic engine. Attacking an opponent's property is a strategic move to disrupt their resource generation and cripple their economic growth.

#### Initiating an Attack

1. **Declaration:** On your turn, you may declare an attack with a **Golem** or **Royal Guard** you control.
2. **Target:** Choose an opponent's property as the target of your attack.
3. **Movement:** If the attacking unit is not already on an adjacent property, it must move to an adjacent property before attacking. A unit cannot attack on the same turn it moves, unless stated otherwise.
4. **Golem Limits:** Remember that Golems cannot be placed or moved onto a Chauffeur.

#### Resolving an Attack on a Property

1. **Defense:** If the targeted property is defended by a **Golem** or **Royal Guard**, a battle occurs (see "Golem vs. Golem Combat" and "Royal Guard vs. Golem Combat" below). The defending unit must be defeated before the property can be damaged.
2. **Property Damage:** If the property is undefended, or the defending unit is defeated, the attacking unit deals damage to the property equal to its **Attack Power** (**Strength** for Royal Guards).
3. **Property Hit Points:**
    *   **Standard Properties:** Have 1 Hit Point.
    *   **Permitted Properties:** (Lands, Spell Shops, Breweries) have 2 Hit Points. When hit for the first time, the permit card on top should spin to cover the property underneath. Properties with permits on top that have been hit no longer generate gold on roll, and cannot be invested in.
4. **Destruction:** When a property's Hit Points are reduced to 0, it is considered destroyed.
    *   **Destroyed Standard Property:** The property card is flipped face down. It no longer generates resources or gold.
    *   **Destroyed Permitted Property:** The permit and property card are both flipped face down. They no longer generate resources or gold.
5. **Resource Seizure:** When a property generates a resource and an attacking **Golem** is on the card, instead of the player that owns the property receiving the resource, it is given to the attacking party. If the attacking Golem is defeated before the property generates resources, the defending player retains control of the property and any resources generated.
6. **Entrenchment:** A property with both an attacking and defending **Golem** are considered entrenched. When entrenched, roll a d6. On a roll of 1-3, the property generates a resource as normal. On a roll of 4-6, the property does not generate a resource that turn.

### Golem vs. Golem Combat: Clashes of Animated Stone

*"Let the earth tremble and the sparks fly as these titans of stone and magic collide. Their battles are a spectacle of raw power, a testament to the might of their creators." - *From "The Golem Wars: A Chronicle of the Animated Conflicts"*

When Golems clash, it's a battle of brute force, special abilities, and strategic positioning.

#### Combat Sequence

1. **Simultaneous Attack:** Both the attacking and defending Golems deal damage to each other simultaneously. The damage dealt is equal to their respective **Attack Powers**.
2. **Special Abilities:** Players can activate their Golems' special abilities during combat, following the costs and conditions outlined on their cards.
3. **Damage Resolution:** Golems' **Hit Points** are reduced by the damage received.
4. **Defeat:** When a Golem's Hit Points are reduced to 0, it is defeated and removed from the game.

#### Terrain Effects

Remember that certain card types provide bonuses or penalties to Golems in combat:

*   **Spell Shop:** +1 Attack Power to any attacking Golem.
*   **Brewery:** +1 Hit Point to any defending Golem.
*   **Chauffeur:** No effect. Golems cannot be placed or moved onto a Chauffeur.
*   **Land Cards:** All Golems have -1 to their Attack Power.

#### Suit Synergy and Combination Attacks

Utilize **Suit Synergy** and **Combination Attacks** to gain an edge in Golem combat. Refer to the "The Animated Guardians: Golems of War and Warding" section for details on these advanced tactics.

### Royal Guard vs. Golem Combat: Valor Against Stone

*"Though outnumbered by the tireless Golems, the Royal Guard stand as beacons of hope, their courage and skill a match for any construct of stone and magic." - *Excerpt from "The Ballad of the Royal Guard"*

When a Royal Guard faces a Golem, it's a battle of human skill and determination against unyielding magical constructs.

#### Combat Sequence

1. **Royal Guard Advantage:** Royal Guards, being highly trained warriors, deal damage to the Golem equal to their **Strength** plus 1.
2. **Golem Retaliation:** If the Golem survives the initial attack, it retaliates, dealing damage to the Royal Guard equal to its **Attack Power**.
3. **Special Abilities:** Players can activate their Royal Guard's special ability *once* upon being played. Golems can use their special abilities as normal during combat.
4. **Damage Resolution:** **Health** and **Hit Points** are reduced by the damage received.
5. **Defeat:** When a Royal Guard's Health or a Golem's Hit Points are reduced to 0, they are defeated and removed from the game.

#### Special Considerations

*   **Royal Guard Abilities:** Remember that activating a Royal Guard's special ability affects the **Cost of the Living** counter.
*   **Imposing Colossus:** The Imposing Colossus's **Center of Attention** ability forces Golems to attack it before targeting other units.
*   **Shielding Sovereign:** The Shielding Sovereign cannot use her **Aegis of the Realm** ability to protect a Royal Guard from a Golem's attack.

### Royal Guard vs. Royal Guard Combat: The Clash of Champions

*"When the Royal Guard meet in battle, it is a contest of skill, strategy, and unwavering loyalty. These are the battles that legends are made of, where the fate of the realm hangs in the balance." - *From the "Chronicles of the Crown: Volume III"*

When Royal Guards clash, it's a duel of legendary proportions, a battle that will be etched into the annals of the Merchant-Mage Council.

#### Combat Sequence

1. **Simultaneous Attack:** Both Royal Guards deal damage to each other simultaneously. The damage dealt is equal to their respective **Strengths**.
2. **Special Abilities:** Players can activate their Royal Guard's special ability *once* upon being played.
3. **Damage Resolution:** Royal Guards' **Health** is reduced by the damage received.
4. **Defeat:** When a Royal Guard's Health is reduced to 0, they are defeated and removed from the game.

#### Special Considerations

*   **Imposing Colossus:** The Imposing Colossus's **Center of Attention** ability forces other Royal Guards to attack it before targeting other units.
*   **Shielding Sovereign:** The Shielding Sovereign cannot use her **Aegis of the Realm** ability to protect a Royal Guard from another Royal Guard's attack.

## Taxmen of the Wizard's Republic (Jokers)

*They are the long arm of the Wizard's Republic, the collectors of dues, the enforcers of fiscal policy. When a Taxman enters the game, even the wealthiest merchant-mage feels a chill of apprehension.*

[//]: # (Visual prompt: A stern-faced, official-looking figure in a dark, formal robe, holding a ledger and a quill. They are surrounded by stacks of gold and official documents. Imposing, realistic fantasy art style.)

*   **Appearance:** The Joker cards, if your deck includes them, represent the Taxmen.
*   **Optional Rule:** The inclusion of Jokers is optional, providing a way to adjust the game's pace. Their presence can speed up the game by adding an additional economic drain. All players must unanimously agree to include or exclude Jokers at the beginning of the game.
*   **Effect:** When a Joker, or **Taxman**, is drawn, it is immediately played.
*   **Tax Collection:** Each player must pay an amount of gold equal to the current **Tax Rate** to the **R.O.W.** (Revenue Office of Wizards). This represents the Taxman's duty to collect the Republic's due.
*   **Reshuffle:** After the Taxman has collected the taxes, the Joker is reshuffled back into the deck, ready to reappear and enforce fiscal policy once more.
    *   The collected tax is placed in the **R.O.W.**, *not* the Central Bank.

> [!TIP]
> The presence of Taxmen adds an element of risk to hoarding gold. Be prepared to pay your dues, or consider investing your gold to keep it safe from the Taxman's grasp.

> [!NOTE]
> For more information on the **Tax Rate** and the **R.O.W.**, refer to the "Taxes" section.

## The Winds of Fortune (Aces)

[//]: # (Visual prompt: A swirling vortex of magical energy, with a playing card at its center. The card is an Ace, and it radiates with power and possibility. Abstract, fantasy art style.)

*   **Appearance:** The Ace cards represent moments of extraordinary luck and opportunity.
*   **Immediate Play:** When an Ace is drawn, it must be played immediately.
*   **Permit Boon:** The player who drew the Ace draws cards from the deck until a **permit** is revealed. This permit is granted to the player for free, representing a sudden opportunity or a stroke of good fortune.
*   **Permit Activation:** The player immediately receives the benefits of the drawn permit as if they had rolled its corresponding number. They also get to keep the permit, adding it to their holdings.
*   **Reshuffle:** The Ace is then reshuffled back into the deck.
*   **No Permit Drawn:** If the deck is depleted and no permit is drawn, the deck is reshuffled. The player continues to draw until a permit is revealed.

> [!TIP]
> Aces can provide a significant advantage, granting free permits that can boost your economic engine. Be prepared to capitalize on these moments of fortune!

## The Sevens of Upheaval (7s)

*They are the forces of inflation, the agents of economic instability. When a Seven is rolled, the very foundations of the market tremble, and the cost of living rises for all.*

[//]: # (Visual prompt: A chaotic scene of a marketplace in disarray. Goods are scattered, people are panicking, and the very air crackles with an unstable energy. Dramatic, impressionistic fantasy art style.)

*   **Trigger:** When a 7 is rolled on the dice during any player's turn.
*   **Immediate Effect:** All **7** cards in the deck are immediately played.
*   **Cost of Living Increase:** The **Cost of the Living** counter increases by the **Volatility** value (default is 1). This represents inflation, impacting all aspects of the game.
*   **Market Instability:**
    *   All invested gold on properties is lost and given to the **Central Bank**. This represents the risks of market speculation during times of uncertainty.
    *   All commodity holders must pay 1 gold to the **Central Bank** to keep each unit of their commodities. This represents the increased cost of storage and maintenance during inflationary periods.
*   **Reshuffle:** After the effects are resolved, all **7** cards are reshuffled back into the deck.

> [!WARNING]
> A roll of 7 can be devastating, wiping out investments and increasing costs for all players. Be prepared for this eventuality, and consider hedging your risks during times of high volatility.

> [!NOTE]
> For more information on the **Cost of the Living** counter and **Volatility**, refer to the "Indicators" section.
